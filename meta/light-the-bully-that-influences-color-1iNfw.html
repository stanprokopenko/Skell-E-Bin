<h2>The Role of Light in Color Perception</h2>

<p>The only reason we see color is because of light. Different types of light, such as sunlight and overcast light, influence colors differently. Sunlight is particularly useful for studying color because it provides two overall families: direct light (sunlight) and ambient light (shadows).</p>

<h2>Influence of Sunlight on Color Temperatures</h2>

<p>Sunlight is a great type of light to study from because it gives you a clear distinction between warm sunlight and cooler shadows. The sun is always a warm light, even though its color changes throughout the day. For example, a sunset is much warmer than a noon sky, but the sun is always warmer than the sky.</p>

<h2>Practical Exercise: Analyzing Sunlight in a Photograph</h2>

<p>Choose a simple photograph with clear sunlight and shadow areas. Use a color picker tool to sample colors in the sunlight. Focus on the hue picker in Photoshop to observe the hue range in sunlit areas. You'll notice that the hues are locked in a specific range due to the influence of the sunlight.</p>

<h2>The Bully Principle of Sunlight</h2>

<p>Sunlight acts as a "bully," influencing the colors it hits to be like it. This means that the hues of objects in sunlight will be pulled toward the sun's hue on the color wheel. For example, if you're painting grass in sunlight, the green will be influenced by the warm sunlight, making it appear warmer.</p>

<h2>Identifying Color Temperatures in Shadows</h2>

<p>In shadow areas, the colors are free from the influence of the direct sunlight. Use the color picker to sample colors in shadow areas and observe the freedom of hues. The blue sky also influences shadow colors, making them cooler. This is because the blue sky shines blue light into the scene, further encouraging colors to move toward blue.</p>

<h2>Practical Exercise: Comparing Light and Shadow Colors</h2>

<p>Sample and paint swatches of colors in both light and shadow areas. Observe the hue and saturation changes between light and shadow. For example, the same object, like gravel or weeds, will have very different colors depending on whether they are in light or shadow.</p>

<h2>The Impact of the Surrounding Environment</h2>

<p>The surrounding environment, such as a big blue sky, plays a significant role in influencing shadow colors. In sunlight, colors tend to be more uniform due to the strong influence of the sun. In shadows, you can find a wider variety of colors because multiple weaker light sources influence them.</p>

<h2>Practical Example: Painting Color Temperature Charts</h2>

<p>Create a color chart for a specific photograph. Identify the warm and cool extremes. Combine hue and saturation changes in your color charts to represent the full range of colors you see in the photograph. For example, the warm colors of a path in sunlight might be in the orange range, while the cool colors in shadow might be in the blue range.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Understanding how light, particularly sunlight, affects color temperatures is crucial for painting. The behavior of colors under different lighting conditions is predictable. Practice with clear photographs to reinforce your learning. Remember, the object is never just a local color; it's about how the light and shadow influence that color.</p>
