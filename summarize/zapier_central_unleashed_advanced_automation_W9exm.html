<p>Zapier is a powerful tool designed to connect various online applications like Gmail, Drive, Shopify, and Facebook to automate workflows using simple logic. It eliminates the need for coding through a user-friendly click-and-drag interface. However, understanding some terminology is essential for setting up more complex automations. The integration of AI technologies, including ChatGPT and OpenAI, has significantly enhanced Zapier's capabilities, enabling more sophisticated and intelligent automations.</p>

<h2>Zapier's AI Integration</h2>

<p><strong>Zapier Central</strong> is an experimental feature launched to simplify the creation of automations using AI. This initiative, along with Zapier's collaboration with OpenAI, allows users to incorporate custom GPTs for specific tasks, leveraging Zapier's extensive app integration infrastructure. Over the past year, Zapier has executed more than half a million AI actions and run over 50 million AI tasks, demonstrating significant progress in AI automation. This advancement aims to reduce manual work by automating a wide range of tasks.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications of AI in Zapier</h2>

<p>One practical application of Zapier's AI integration is the creation of personalized videos for new customers or leads. This process involves extracting customer names from emails or Google Sheets, creating a video template in Haen (an AI video generator), and then sending the personalized video to the customer. The automation checks periodically for the video's completion before sending it, ensuring the customer receives it once ready. Setting up these automations requires selecting the correct triggers and actions, which, while not overly complicated, necessitates some understanding of the services involved.</p>

<h2>Development of AI Bots</h2>

<p>In the past six months, I've been working on a new product called <strong>AI Bots</strong>, part of Zapier Central, aimed at making automation more accessible through AI. AI Bots is designed to help people successfully use, figure out, discover, and adopt automation using AI. The concept of "Behaviors" was introduced to customize what the AI Bots can do on behalf of the user. For example, programming the bot to perform tasks such as scheduling and summarizing today's meetings from Google Calendar and sending the summary to Slack with an automation-inspired quote.</p>

<h2>Demonstration of AI Bots</h2>

<p>During a demonstration, I set up an AI bot to perform specific tasks, such as finding events on Google Calendar and sending a direct message on Slack. After selecting specific calendars and Slack values for these actions, I tested the bot to ensure it worked as expected. The bot uses threading to group context together for tasks it performs and has self-healing capabilities, allowing it to adjust and fix issues autonomously. Initially, the bot can guess and infer actions, but I've learned that users often prefer more control over the bot's decisions. This control allows for a wider range of use cases by giving deterministic control over the bot's actions.</p>

<h2>User Feedback and Future Directions</h2>

<p>Consistency and reliability are crucial for AI automation, and receiving real user feedback is a significant part of improving these bots. Users perceive that by giving feedback, they are making their individual instance of the software better. The roadmap includes incorporating user feedback to enhance the bots' performance. Zapier AI bots support over 7,000 integrations, allowing for a wide range of actions and workflows. The service is available without a waitlist, and users can start using it immediately with an existing Zapier account or by signing up for a new one.</p>
