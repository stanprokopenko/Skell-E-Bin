<p>Welcome to step five, focusing on <strong>proportions in head drawing</strong>. Previously, you set up the gesture, shaped the big components, and organized the head's relationship to the neck and body. Now, you'll dig into basic proportions using a rough system of <strong>halves and thirds</strong>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Landmarks</h2>

<p>Consider <strong>landmarks</strong> as any bone visible through the skin. Drawing from skulls can help you understand these landmarks, like the Proko-made Loomis skull.</p>

<h2>The Brow Ridge</h2>

<p>Return to the placement of the brow from previous steps. The <strong>brow ridge</strong> is not the eyebrow but the projection of bone at the bottom of the forehead. </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Gender differences</strong>: Women typically have a vertical forehead, while men have a diagonal one.</li>

<li>The brow ridge protects the eye and can develop a <strong>superciliary arch</strong> in hyper-masculine men.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Gender Differences in Facial Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>chin</strong> can also show gender differences: men might have a broader, boxier chin, while women might have a softer, more recessed chin.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Proportional Breakdown Using Halves and Thirds</h2>

<p>Break up proportions using <strong>halves and thirds</strong>. </p>

<ul>

<li>The first half between the brow and chin is the base of the nose. Focus on where the nose is flush with the face, not the cartilage or nostrils.</li>

<li>Think of head construction as dissolving the figure into geometries, aiming for an ideal version.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Key Facial Structures and Their Proportions</h2>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>nasal aperture</strong> is a key shape, varying in form and contributing to likeness.</li>

<li>The bottom of the socket is halfway between the brow and the base of the nose.</li>

<li>The <strong>cheekbone</strong> creates the bottom of the socket and connects various parts of the face.</li>

<li>The center of the eye and the <strong>keystone (glabella)</strong> are halfway between the brow and the bottom of the socket. The keystone helps space the eyes correctly.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Dividing the Area from Nose to Chin</h2>

<p>Divide the area from the base of the nose to the chin into <strong>three equal parts</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>The first line marks where the lips part.</li>

<li>The second line indicates the top of the chin.</li>

</ul>

<p>These divisions are averages to help organize the big idea, allowing for adjustments.</p>

<h2>Gender Indicators in the Mastoid Process and Jaw Angles</h2>

<p>The <strong>mastoid process</strong> and <strong>jaw angles</strong> can indicate gender differences.</p>

<h2>Integrating Proportions into Initial Steps</h2>

<p>Focus on simple halves and thirds, but acknowledge the wealth of knowledge for advancing likeness. Integrate these proportions back into your initial four steps.</p>
