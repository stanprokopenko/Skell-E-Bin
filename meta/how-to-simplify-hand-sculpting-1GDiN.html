<p>I'm Andrew Joseph Keith, and in this lesson, we're going to look at how to create simple, quick hand gesture studies in clay using a technique I like to call <strong>middle's pinky thumb</strong>. This technique makes sculpting the hand a lot easier. Let's get into it.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Hand</h2>

<p>As you already know, the hand is very complex. The first thing we're going to focus on is simplifying the hand. One of my favorite simplifications involves focusing primarily on the placement and gesture from the forearm to the middle three fingers of the handâ€”the ring, middle, and pointer fingers. Then, the thumb and pinky are added afterward along with the muscle forms that correspond to the thumb and pinky. Hence the name, <strong>middle's pinky thumb</strong>.</p>

<p>The reason this simplification is so effective is that it's much easier to understand and follow the gesture from the middle of the forearm to the wrist to these three fingers than it is to try to understand the gesture of the whole hand. Like we try to do with other types of sculpture, it's all about starting simple and then adding complexity. Simplicity doesn't mean sacrificing realism. It's about breaking down the complex shapes and forms into manageable forms that serve as a foundation for the realistic forms and details that we build on top.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Sculpting Process</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Create the Middle Three, Wrist, and Forearm</h3>

<p>For this, start with a long flat shape that begins thick and cylindrical at the forearm, becomes more boxy at the wrist, and then more flat as it tapers towards the three middle fingers. Think of it like a teardrop shape that has been stretched and flattened. Observe your own hand with the thumb and pinky extended and the other fingers together in that neutral position. Here's what it should look like. If you're struggling, you can use the sculptor's cheat sheet by holding your sculpture up to your arm, closing one eye, and looking through your sculpture at your reference or at your own arm. This allows you to compare the silhouette of your arm with the silhouette of your sculpture.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add the Masses of the Pinky and Thumb</h3>

<p>Start with the thumb by pressing out a chicken drumstick-shaped piece of clay that's pressed flat. The thick, flat, rounded part starts at the wrist and then tapers as it moves up and out toward the end of the thumb. The pinky is more like a bowling pin shape, thin and cylindrical. It's pretty straightforward to sculpt using a coil of clay that should be slightly longer than the piece of clay used for the thumb.</p>

<p>By adding these two simplified forms of the thumb and pinky, it's starting to look much more like a hand. Also, add in the smaller mass of clay that represents the teardrop-shaped muscle mass on the back of the thumb, between the thumb and pointer finger. These are the three basic muscular forms of the hand: the papa bear, mama bear, and little baby bear. We'll go over these forms more in-depth when we get into the anatomy of the hand, but for now, simplicity is what we're going for.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Block Out the Fingers</h3>

<p>Now we can start to shape the individual fingers. Indicate where the separation of the middle fingers takes place. Keep in mind that because the webbing of the fingers is sloped towards the inside of the palm at an angle, the separation of the fingers is a little bit higher on the inside palm of the hand and a little bit lower on the back of the hand. Indicate the knuckles by adding mass in those areas.</p>

<p>The thumb has two large knuckles. The first large knuckle is about halfway between the base of the thumb and the tip of the thumb. Halfway is that first big knuckle, and then the next big knuckle is halfway between that first knuckle and the tip of the thumb. Add a small coil of clay to represent the padding on the inside palm of the hand where the first large knuckles of the fingers are.</p>

<p>Now, take some time to clean things up and give more precise indications of the tips of the fingers, the separation between the forms, and some of the details of the wrist. Don't take too long to build these details though. Remember, this is primarily meant to be a quick gesture study. For this one, it took me about 20 minutes to finish, and I recommend trying not to take longer than 30 minutes on these first gesture studies.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Your assignment is to do three of these quick gesture studies using <strong>middle's pinky thumb</strong>. The first one should be this hand in a neutral position. Then, use this same technique and do two additional studies using a hand pose of your choice. Try to choose a pose where you can group together those three middle fingers. It could be a fist, a relaxed hand, or grabbing something like a ball. We just want to get used to seeing the hand as those three middle fingers, the pinky, and the thumb as separate entities with their own gesture.</p>
