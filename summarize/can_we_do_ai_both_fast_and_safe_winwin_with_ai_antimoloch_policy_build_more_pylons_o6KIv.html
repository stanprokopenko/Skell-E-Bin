<p>As someone who has been engaging in conversations with various thinkers in the AI space, I've crystallized my position on the balance between open source and closed source AI research. The primary thing I want to optimize for is research, and I believe that we need both open source and closed source to achieve this goal.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Closed Source AI</strong></p>

<p>Closed source AI has several advantages:</p>

<ul>

<li>Courts can hold companies accountable for any harm caused by their AI systems.</li>

<li>The market can hold companies accountable through consumer choices and subscription decisions.</li>

<li>Financial incentives drive investment in AI infrastructure and research, with companies like Amazon and Microsoft investing up to $100 billion.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages of Open Source AI</strong></p>

<p>Open source AI is absolutely critical for research:</p>

<ul>

<li>It allows researchers to conduct ablation tests and experiments on models like llama.</li>

<li>Companies like Meta and Google have made their tools available to universities and other companies, greatly amplifying the amount of research that can be done.</li>

<li>Even big tech companies participate in open source research by providing grants and credits to researchers.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>The Necessity of Both Open Source and Closed Source</strong></p>

<p>It's important to understand that this is not an either-or situation. We absolutely need both open source and closed source AI research:</p>

<ul>

<li>Closed source protects intellectual property rights and incentivizes investment.</li>

<li>Open source provides tools and resources for researchers worldwide.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Optimizing for Research</h2>

<p><strong>My Primary Policy</strong></p>

<p>My primary policy is to optimize for the total amount of research being done. The way I see it, we need a certain amount of "research points" to get to both the safe ending and the utopian ending that we all want. More research is what underpins both of these goals.</p>

<p><strong>The False Dichotomy of Safety vs. Acceleration</strong></p>

<p>Some people frame the debate as a choice between safety and acceleration, or between open source and closed source. I believe this is a false dichotomy. The real goal should be finding a win-win solution through optimizing for research.</p>

<p><strong>The Benefits of Optimizing for Research</strong></p>

<p>By optimizing for research, we can:</p>

<ul>

<li>Accelerate progress towards solving problems like disease, aging, and climate change.</li>

<li>Drive economic growth and create new opportunities.</li>

<li>Inspire more people to get into AI research and contribute to the field.</li>

</ul>

<p>In conclusion, I believe that the current balance between open source and closed source AI research is close to optimal. We should focus on optimizing for research, as this is the key to achieving both safety and acceleration in AI development. By working together and understanding the economic and technological incentives at play, we can reach a future where AI benefits all of humanity.</p>
