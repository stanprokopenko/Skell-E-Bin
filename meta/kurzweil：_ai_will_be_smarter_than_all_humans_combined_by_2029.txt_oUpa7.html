<p><strong>AI's Journey to Matching Human Intelligence</strong></p>

<p>In 1999, a bold prediction was made: by 2029, AI would be able to match human intelligence. This forecast, suggesting AI would achieve this milestone within a 30-year timeline, was initially met with skepticism. Critics doubted the feasibility, with some believing it would take a century for AI to reach this level of intelligence. Yet, AI has already demonstrated its creativity, inventing moves in complex games previously thought beyond its capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding the Skepticism</strong></p>

<p>The skepticism wasn't without reason. At a Stanford conference, experts gathered to dissect this prediction, revealing a broader academic interest and debate. A significant barrier to accepting this rapid growth forecast lies in our understanding of growth itself. Economists and many others traditionally view growth linearly, which leads to underestimating the potential for exponential progress. This linear perspective has been a stumbling block in recognizing the swift advancements in AI.</p>

<p><strong>The Evidence of Exponential Growth</strong></p>

<p>To truly grasp AI's rapid advancements, one must look at the historical growth in computing power. A chart spanning from 1939 to 2023 illustrates this perfectly. On a logarithmic scale, we see a straight line representing the exponential growth in the price performance of computation. From 0.00007 calculations per second per constant dollar in 1939 to 35 billion calculations per second in recent times, we've witnessed a 20 quadrillion fold increase over 80 years. This growth has been consistent, unaffected by external factors such as war or peace, and has continued across various technological eras.</p>

<p><strong>Consistency Across Decades</strong></p>

<p>This consistency in technological advancement is noteworthy. The first 40 years of exponential growth in computing power went largely unnoticed, with no specific growth target in mind. Yet, the prediction of continued exponential growth has held true, with recent data points aligning perfectly with expectations. This steady rate of advancement, regardless of the technology used, underscores the reliability of predictions regarding the exponential growth of computing power and, by extension, AI's capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: A Future Shaped by AI</strong></p>

<p>The journey of AI, from skepticism to a recognized potential to match human intelligence by 2029, is a testament to the power of exponential growth. Despite initial doubts and the challenge of understanding this type of growth, the historical and ongoing advancements in computing power lend strong support to the prediction. The consistency of technological advancement, through various global conditions, further reinforces the expectation that AI will continue to evolve at an exponential rate. As we move closer to 2029, the anticipation of AI reaching, and possibly surpassing, human intelligence becomes more plausible, marking a fascinating chapter in the evolution of technology.</p>
