<h2>Ambient Light on Overcast Days</h2>

<p>Ambient light is a <strong>diffuse light</strong>. On an overcast day, the sky is full of clouds, and the sun is behind those clouds. The clouds act as a giant diffusing filter, scattering the light and making it come from all directions. This type of light is softer because the light rays are coming from all directions, unlike direct sunlight.</p>

<h2>Color Temperature on Overcast Days</h2>

<p>On an overcast day, the color temperatures we see in sunlight are flipped. In sunlight, the light is warmer than the shadows. In an overcast situation, the light coming from the sky is cooler. It's not necessarily blue because the cloud cover eliminates a lot of the blueness of the sky. Generally, an overcast sky will be in the <strong>steely blues</strong>, somewhere in the desaturated range.</p>

<p>This isn't just a guess; it's scientifically documented on the Kelvin scale, which measures color temperature. On this scale, overcast daylight falls into the desaturated blues.</p>

<h3>Practical Demonstration</h3>

<p>Using a color picker, we can see the influence of overcast light on color temperature. For example, sampling the white walls in a photograph shows a desaturated blue. White walls are a good indicator of the light source color because they get all their color from the light hitting them. </p>

<h2>Influence of Ambient Light on Surfaces</h2>

<h3>Sampling Colors</h3>

<p>Let's sample colors from different surfaces to see how ambient light affects them:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>White Walls</strong>: Sampling shows a desaturated blue, indicating the color of the light source.</li>

<li><strong>Shingles</strong>: The local color of shingles might be a desaturated orange (brownish). The overcast light pulls this color towards a desaturated purplish hue.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Analysis of Local Color vs. Perceived Color</h3>

<p>We never actually see local color; we see the object plus the light. For example, shingles might appear as a desaturated purplish hue under overcast light. This shows how the light source influences the perceived color.</p>

<h3>Influence on Saturation and Hue</h3>

<p>Overcast light, being diffuse, is weaker than direct sunlight but still influences colors. It pulls colors towards its own hue, desaturating them. For example, shingles might show a path from their local color to a desaturated purplish hue under overcast light.</p>

<h2>Practical Painting Exercise</h2>

<h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Select Light Color</strong>: Use the color picker to select the light color from the wall in the photograph. It should be a cooled-off, neutralized warm.</li>

<li><strong>Paint the Light Area</strong>: Paint the light area on your canvas using the selected color.</li>

<li><strong>Select Shadow Color</strong>: Shadows are darker and warmer. Use the color picker to select a shadow color, which should be warmer and more saturated.</li>

<li><strong>Paint the Shadow Area</strong>: Paint the shadow area, creating soft edges with big brushstrokes.</li>

<li><strong>Add Occlusion Shadows</strong>: Occlusion shadows are in the deepest crevices where ambient light can't reach. Select a darker, warmer color and paint these areas with soft edges.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Adjusting Colors</h3>

<p>Adjust the colors for a pleasing transition from occlusion shadows to form shadows and then to the cool light. This creates a realistic effect that matches the photograph.</p>

<p>We've discussed the theoretical aspects of ambient light on overcast days, including its characteristics, color temperature, and influence on surfaces. By using practical painting exercises, we can apply these concepts to create realistic paintings. Now, let's put this into practice and do some actual paintings!</p>
