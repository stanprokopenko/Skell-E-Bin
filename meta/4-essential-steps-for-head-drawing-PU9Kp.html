<p>Understanding the four essential steps to posing portraits is crucial, especially during the gesture stage of head drawing. Focusing on these steps helps you capture the positioning and emotive expression of the head, neck, and shoulders, rather than getting bogged down in details like the eyes and nose.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Sizing the Skull</h2>

<p><strong>Basic Skull Sizing and Shaping</strong>

- Start with the basic sizing and shaping of the skull.

- Heads are rarely completely vertical. Use straight two-dimensional lines to gauge the lean and tilt.

- Shoulders are usually not horizontal. Exaggerate the diagonals for a better effect.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Leaning and Tilting the Head</h2>

<p><strong>Inclusion of the Jaw</strong>

- Pay attention to the jaw, especially in three-quarter views.

- Female skulls may have narrower jaws, so customize shapes accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Neck Representation</strong>

- Use C and S curves to represent the muscle and skin stretch of the neck.

- Rib cages are off-angle, higher in the back, and lower in the front.</p>

<p><strong>Aligning Features</strong>

- Use center lines to match the model's head position and ensure proper three-quarter views.

- Align the brow and ear, noting that the ear is usually lower than the brow.

- Draw ellipses to represent head tilts and perspectives.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Positioning the Jaw</h2>

<p><strong>Importance in Three-Quarter Views</strong>

- The jaw's position is crucial in three-quarter views.

- Customize for gender differences, with fuller shapes for neck muscles and skin stretch.</p>

<p><strong>Using Center Lines</strong>

- Use center lines for head position to ensure proper three-quarter views.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Rotation and Perspective</h2>

<p><strong>Understanding Rotation and Perspective</strong>

- Understand the rotation of the head and basic perspective, whether you are viewing from above or below.

- Use ellipses to reflect perspective in head lifts.

- Exaggerate tilts to avoid a static quality and make drawings more expressive.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding Flat Outlines</strong>

- Use T-overlaps and wrapping lines to suggest form and surface, avoiding flat outlines.

- Adjust neck contours to leave room for muscle building.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls</h2>

<p><strong>Practicing Different Head Orientations</strong>

- Practice with different head orientations, such as three-quarter and profile views.

- Use the size of your palm for initial sphere drawing for better practice.</p>

<p><strong>Noting Emotions in Poses</strong>

- Note emotions like annoyance in poses to understand the model's expression.

- Combine steps like brow to ear alignment for efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding Common Errors</strong>

- Avoid overly curved center lines to prevent perspective distortion.

- Practice faster sketches to build confidence and accuracy.

- Focus on one piece at a time to avoid overwhelming yourself.</p>

<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>

<p><strong>Maintaining Turn or Rotation</strong>

- Maintain the turn or rotation of the sphere, focusing on slightly under, three-quarter views.

- Use the tilt line as a symmetry line.</p>

<p><strong>Indicating Overlapping and Pinching</strong>

- Indicate overlapping and pinching of the neck.

- Mentally note the ear's position without drawing it.</p>

<p><strong>Handling Head Tilts</strong>

- For a head tilt with a forward push, note the crazy tilt angle for the shoulder.

- Be careful with the placement of bone versus muscle.</p>

<h2>Expression and Structure</h2>

<p><strong>Separating Expression from Structure</strong>

- Separate expression from the basic head structure.

- Focus on size, tilt, rotation, and perspective.

- Avoid getting overly invested in small features early on.</p>

<p><strong>Using Triangles for Design</strong>

- Use triangles to design and think about figures, especially in profiles and intersections.

- Adjust the ellipse to change the view angle.</p>

<h2>Anatomy and Connection</h2>

<p><strong>Incorporating Under Plane</strong>

- Incorporate the under plane to gel with the neck.

- Visualize the connection between the eyebrow and the top of the ear.</p>

<p><strong>Creating Plane Change</strong>

- Create a plane change to show the bottom plane of the jaw.

- Understand the anatomy of the neck and jaw, including the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage.</p>

<p><strong>Using Ellipse for Surface Understanding</strong>

- Use the ellipse to understand the surface and build connections with other forms.

- Notice the width and turn of the shoulder for different emotional expressions.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Set up the head shape with slight three-quarter views and mild ellipses. Think about the non-verbal sense of body posture, such as honesty or sadness. Practice and refine these techniques to improve your portrait drawing skills.</p>
