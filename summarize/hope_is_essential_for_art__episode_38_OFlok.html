<h2><strong>Understanding Hope</strong></h2>

<p>Hope is both a <strong>noun</strong> and a <strong>verb</strong>, embodying a desire accompanied by an expectation of fulfillment. It's a complex concept, yet we have an innate understanding of its function in our lives. Hope is brave, requiring vulnerability and the courage to face potential disappointment.</p>

<h2><strong>Hope and Art Creation</strong></h2>

<p>Hope is intrinsically linked to art making, serving as a crucial component in the creative process. It sustains and motivates us, allowing for the possibility of beneficial outcomes. When starting a new project, hope is what drives us to believe in the potential for success, to learn something new, or to refine a skill. Without hope, we set ourselves up for frustration and missed opportunities.</p>

<h3><strong>Personal Reflections on Hope</strong></h3>

<p>Personally, I've struggled with hope, often defaulting to pessimism as a safety mechanism to avoid disappointment. This approach, while protective, limits excitement about future possibilities and joy in life. I'm working hard to embrace hope, despite its risks, because it's essential for believing in the success of a piece or project.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategies for Fostering Hope</strong></h3>

<p>To foster hope, I use two sketchbooks: one for fun, experimental work without expectations, and another for more refined, artistic endeavors. This approach allows for exploration and refinement, balancing the freedom to experiment with the focus on producing quality work. For those feeling hopeless about their art, examining past work to build logical assumptions or seeking external perspectives can be helpful. Beginners should focus on fun and basics, understanding that learning art is a long journey.</p>

<h2><strong>The Role of Hope in Trying New Things</strong></h2>

<p>Hope encourages us to take risks and try new things, like experimenting with different mediums or techniques. It opens up our minds to new opportunities, motivating us to step out of our comfort zones. Without hope, we might stick to what's safe and familiar, missing out on the growth that comes from embracing the unknown.</p>

<h2><strong>Philosophical Implications of Hope</strong></h2>

<p>Hope carries with it several assumptions about the world:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Beauty exists</strong>: Hope assumes that beauty is real, viewable, and achievable, driving us to create art that reflects or enhances beauty.</li>

<li><strong>The world is full of beauty</strong>: It assumes that there are things beautiful enough to depict, encouraging us to explore and represent the beauty around us.</li>

<li><strong>People deserve beauty</strong>: This assumption goes both ways, suggesting that artists and viewers alike deserve to partake in beauty. Art transforms our thoughts, feelings, and realities into something that can convey beauty, a responsibility that enriches humanity.</li>

</ul>

<p>Embracing hope is challenging but necessary. It opens us up to the risk of disappointment but also to the potential for joy and fulfillment in our creative endeavors. Hope is the bravest thing of all, and as artists, we must choose to believe in the possibility of success, no matter how uncertain the future may seem.
