<h2>Initial Sketching Approach</h2>

<p>I started by choosing a <strong>classic car from the 1920s or 1930s</strong> to draw. My focus was on capturing a <strong>three-quarter view angle</strong>, paying close attention to details like <strong>fenders, wheels, and the windshield</strong>. This initial sketch was crucial for understanding a potential angle for drawing vehicles.</p>

<h2>Manipulation for Creative Exploration</h2>

<p>After laying down the initial sketch, I began <strong>manipulating the car's shape and details</strong>. This included <strong>twisting the front grill and stretching the windshield</strong>. My goal was to make the drawing visually more interesting by capturing <strong>action, movement, and energy</strong>. This process of manipulation allowed me to creatively explore beyond the constraints of reality.</p>

<h2>Balancing Observation and Free Drawing</h2>

<p>It's important to balance drawing from observation with drawing freely for fun. Both approaches are mixed in my practice. Drawing from observation helps to <strong>build a visual vocabulary</strong>, while free drawing allows for <strong>creative exploration</strong>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Basic Structures</h2>

<p>Drawing familiar subjects, like vehicles or animals, makes it easier to manipulate details and proportions. Understanding the <strong>basic structure</strong> of these subjects helps in drawing them from various angles without needing to remember every detail. This knowledge facilitates easier manipulation.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Reality or Stylization</h2>

<p>When it comes to shadow design, the choice between focusing on <strong>reality or stylization</strong> is intentional. My aim is for consistency in the artwork's aesthetic, whether that leans more towards a realistic portrayal or a stylized one.</p>

<h2>Speed and Confidence in Drawing</h2>

<p><strong>Speed in drawing</strong> comes from familiarity with the subject. This allows for quick, confident strokes without overthinking details. Transitioning from pencil to brush pen was influenced by a class that emphasized building confidence in line work through <strong>repetition and familiarity</strong>.</p>

<h2>Influence of Other Artists</h2>

<p>Meeting and working with artists like <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> and others in the <strong>Superani collective</strong> has influenced my approach and style. This influence comes through shared techniques, interests, and communal learning.</p>

<h2>Expressing Motion, Emotion, and Personal Experience</h2>

<p>Drawing is not just about logical representation. It's also about expressing <strong>motion, emotion, and personal experience</strong>. Each sketch is a valuable part of the learning and creative process, allowing for personal expression beyond the constraints of reality.</p>
