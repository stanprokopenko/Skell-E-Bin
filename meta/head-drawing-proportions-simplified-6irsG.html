<p>In this fifth step of head drawing setup, you'll focus on basic proportions using a system of <strong>halves and thirds</strong>. This approach simplifies the complex structure of the face, making it easier to understand and draw. While learning these proportions, it's crucial to grasp the underlying skull structure. To enhance your understanding, try drawing from skulls - the Proko-made Loomis skull is an excellent resource for this practice.</p>

<p>Remember, these proportions are guidelines based on an <strong>ideal or averaged version</strong> of facial features. As you progress, you'll learn to customize these proportions to create unique characters and likenesses.</p>

<h2>Key Facial Landmarks</h2>

<p>Before diving into specific proportions, let's review two key landmarks: the brow and the chin.</p>

<h3>Brow</h3>

<p>When referring to the brow, we're not talking about the eyebrow, but the <strong>brow ridge</strong>. This is the projection of bone at the bottom of the forehead. Consider these gender differences:</p>

<ul>

<li>Women typically have a more vertical forehead</li>

<li>Men often have a diagonal lean to the forehead</li>

</ul>

<p>In highly masculine faces, look for the <strong>super ciliary arch</strong> - a cashew-shaped bone development in the upper corner of the brow.</p>

<h3>Chin</h3>

<p>The chin can vary significantly between genders:</p>

<ul>

<li>Male chins are often broader with a possible divot in the middle</li>

<li>Female chins tend to have a softer, more recessive angle</li>

</ul>

<h2>Halves of the Face</h2>

<p>Start by dividing the face into halves from the brow to the chin.</p>

<h3>First Half: Brow to Base of Nose</h3>

<p>The <strong>base of the nose</strong> marks the halfway point between the brow and chin. This isn't the cartilage or nostrils, but where the nose is most flush with the face. It corresponds to the middle of the nasal aperture in the skull.</p>

<h3>Second Half: Subdivisions</h3>

<p>Divide the upper half (brow to base of nose) into two more halves:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Bottom of the eye socket</strong>: Halfway between the brow and base of nose. This is created by the cheekbone, which forms a glasses-like structure around the eye.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Center of the eye and keystone</strong>: Halfway between the brow and bottom of the socket. The keystone (or glabella) is the bone between the eyes, helping to space them correctly.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Thirds of the Lower Face</h2>

<p>Divide the lower half of the face (base of nose to chin) into thirds:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>First third</strong>: Where the lips part (separation of upper and lower denture)</li>

<li><strong>Second third</strong>: Top of the chin</li>

</ol>

<h2>Additional Considerations for Character Customization</h2>

<p>As you become more comfortable with these basic proportions, consider these elements for creating unique characters:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mastoid process</strong>: The bone behind the ear can vary in size between genders, affecting neck size.</li>

<li><strong>Jaw angles</strong>: The angle of the jaw can significantly impact character appearance.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, you can adjust these proportions up or down to create different facial types. Think of it like customizing a character in a video game - you're pushing and pulling features to create a unique look.</p>

<h2>Integrating Proportions with Previous Steps</h2>

<p>As you apply these proportions, remember to integrate them with the initial four steps of your head drawing setup. This new knowledge should enhance your existing framework, not replace it.</p>

<p>By mastering these proportions and understanding how to customize them, you'll be well on your way to creating diverse and interesting character faces in your artwork.</p>
