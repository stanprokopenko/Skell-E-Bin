<h2>Reviewing Basic Proportional Guidelines</h2>

<p>Start by setting up the <strong>sphere and centerline</strong> for the head. In the early stages, don't be afraid to <strong>exaggerate</strong> features - you'll add more information later, which naturally tones down exaggerations.</p>

<p>Key proportional divisions to remember:</p>

<ul>

<li>Half-face at the nose</li>

<li>Halfway between nose and brow for eye sockets</li>

<li>Halfway between sockets and brow for eyes and keystone</li>

<li>Thirds for mouth and chin</li>

</ul>

<p>These guidelines provide a solid foundation for building the head's structure.</p>

<h2>Applying Proportions to Different Head Angles</h2>

<h3>Front View</h3>

<p>Begin with the basic layout and proportions. Pay close attention to maintaining <strong>consistent surface curvature</strong>. Every line should describe a surface that's consistent with what you've set up with the brow. All lines should communicate across the form, wrapping with the same surface.</p>

<h3>Three-Quarter View</h3>

<p>Adapt your proportional guidelines to this angle. Remember to include <strong>offset axes for the neck</strong>. The cheekbone structure becomes more prominent in this view - it's key to understanding age in portraits.</p>

<h3>Upward and Downward Views</h3>

<p>Even in these challenging angles, the basic proportional divisions still work. What changes is the <strong>projection of features</strong> off the face. For example, in an upward view, the nose's cartilage appears closer to the eye, but the underlying proportions remain the same.</p>

<h3>Profile and Near-Profile Views</h3>

<p>In profile views, pay attention to the <strong>rhythm and asymmetry</strong> of facial features. Notice the beautiful balance of forms: forehead out, socket back, nose forward, back, cheekbone forward, back. This balancing act continues down to the lips.</p>

<h3>Back View</h3>

<p>While you might not use all the same proportional guidelines, you can still apply some. Use landmarks like the ears and brow ridge to establish your perspective. Draw through forms to understand the full structure, even if parts are hidden.</p>

<h2>Surface Consistency and Form</h2>

<p>Always strive to maintain <strong>consistent surface curvature</strong> across the head. Your guidelines should communicate across the form, helping to create a cohesive, three-dimensional shape.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening and Perspective</h2>

<p>When dealing with extreme angles, adapt your proportional guidelines but remember that the underlying structure remains the same. The key is to <strong>draw through forms</strong>, understanding the full structure even when parts are hidden or foreshortened.</p>

<h2>Bone Structure and Aging</h2>

<p>Understanding bone structure is crucial for portraying age. The <strong>cheekbone</strong> is particularly important:</p>

<ul>

<li>In youth, facial fat conceals bone structure</li>

<li>As we age, fat retreats, revealing more of the skull</li>

<li>This transition is visible in the "cashew" shape that develops around the cheekbone in older faces</li>

</ul>

<h2>Asymmetry and Rhythm in Head Drawing</h2>

<p>Embrace the <strong>natural balance of bone and muscle</strong> in the face. This is particularly noticeable in profile views, where you see a beautiful cadence of forms balancing each other. Apply this sense of rhythm to your three-dimensional drawings as well.</p>

<h2>Advanced Considerations</h2>

<p>As you become more comfortable with these steps, aim to <strong>collapse them for more economical drawing</strong>. The goal is to eventually do direct line drawings where your lines are informed by all this underlying information.</p>

<p>For challenging angles, be creative in how you apply proportional guidelines. Always <strong>draw through forms</strong>, even in back views, to fully understand the structure you're depicting.</p>

<p>Remember, drawing is about translating what you see into marks on paper. There will always be a gap between the drawing and the thing being drawn. Your goal is to create a useful abstraction that communicates the essence of what you're seeing.</p>
