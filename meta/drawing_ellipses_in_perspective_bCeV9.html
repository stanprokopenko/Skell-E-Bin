<p>I'm going to show you how to draw a square in perspective and then fit an ellipse inside it. The goal is to keep the square's proportions accurate to ensure the ellipse fits perfectly inside.</p>

<h2><strong>Constructing the Square</strong></h2>

<ul>

<li>I start with one plane of the square, making sure it looks like a perfect square in perspective. This involves adjusting the length and width to avoid making it too long or too short. I rely on my intuition to achieve this.</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Identifying Key Points for the Ellipse</strong></h2>

<ul>

<li>A circle inside a square touches the square at the midpoint of every edge. To find these four points on our square in perspective, I draw an X across the square. This X helps me locate the exact midpoints on each side of the square. These points indicate where the ellipse will touch the square's edges.</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Drawing the Ellipse</strong></h2>

<ul>

<li>The minor axis of the ellipse must align with the square's diagonal line and cross the center point. The major axis is perpendicular to the minor axis. By sketching lightly, I ensure the ellipse touches the identified points and aligns with the axes correctly. The ellipse's longest part follows the major axis, and it's symmetrical in all four quadrants.</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Adjusting the Ellipse's Axes</strong></h2>

<ul>

<li>Initially, I placed the major axis directly through the square's center, but I realized it should be slightly offset. The true center of the ellipse is a bit farther away from us due to perspective. This adjustment ensures the ellipse is not an oval but a perfect ellipse, symmetrical in both directions.</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Extending the Concept to Draw a Cylinder</strong></h2>

<ul>

<li>To create a box, I project the square to the other side, making sure there's a significant distance between the two squares. This distance and the perspective make the second square appear more like a perfect square compared to the first one, which looks more like a squished diamond.</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Drawing the Second Ellipse</strong></h2>

<ul>

<li>I use the same principles to find the key points and axes for the second ellipse. However, due to perspective, the major axis of this ellipse is very close to the center, making the ellipse appear flatter and wider than the first one. This difference in appearance is due to the ellipses being at different distances from the viewer.</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Finalizing the Cylinder in a Box</strong></h2>

<ul>

<li>After sketching the second ellipse and adjusting its shape based on perspective, I observe the differences between the two ellipses. The second ellipse is flatter, wider, and overall smaller because it's farther in the distance. This creates the illusion of a cylinder stuffed into a box, drawn as accurately as possible.</li>

</ul>

<p>This guide walked you through the process of drawing a square in perspective, fitting an ellipse inside it, and then extending the concept to draw a cylinder within a box by adding another ellipse in perspective. The key to success is understanding the relationship between the square and the ellipse, the importance of axes, and how perspective affects the shape and size of the drawn objects.</p>
