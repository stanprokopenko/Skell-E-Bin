<h2>My Background and Predictions in AI</h2>

<p>I've been working in the field of artificial intelligence for 61 years now, which is longer than any other human alive. Back in 1999, I predicted that a computer would be able to pass the Turing test by the year 2029. </p>

<p>Recent progress with large language models has actually been happening faster than I anticipated, perhaps 1-2 years ahead of my original predictions. However, I still believe we will achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) and see a computer pass a rigorous Turing test by 2029.</p>

<h2>The Exponential Growth of Technology</h2>

<p>One of the key things to understand is that technology progresses exponentially over time. I've charted this trend over a span of 80 years. It's this exponential growth in computational power that enables major advances like the development of large language models.</p>

<p>As AI systems approach a trillion connections, a level of complexity similar to the human brain, they will begin to perform more and more like human intelligence. It's not just about raw computational power though - the software and learning algorithms are also critically important.</p>

<h2>AI Matching the Capabilities of Human Intelligence</h2>

<p>I believe there is nothing that happens in the human brain, including consciousness and emotion, that cannot ultimately be captured through computation and mathematics. However, consciousness is not something that can be scientifically proven in a definitive way.</p>

<h2>Implications for Human Longevity</h2>

<p>By 2029, through what I call "longevity escape velocity", a single year of scientific progress will add back more than a year to the lifespans of those who are diligent about their health. </p>

<p>Then by the 2045 "singularity", it will become possible to fully capture and back up the contents of a human brain, enabling truly radical life extension. Most people in the audience today could potentially live to be 500 years old or more.</p>

<p>Now, this doesn't provide an absolute guarantee of immortality, as some global catastrophe could still potentially wipe out both the technology and the backups. But I believe we will overcome most limitations by 2045.</p>

<h2>Computers and Creativity</h2>

<p>In the next 10 years, computers will be able to do virtually everything the human brain can do, with the exception of some high-level creative tasks that require imagining what might work.</p>

<p>We've seen an example recently with the development of the mRNA vaccines. They were created by using AI to simulate billions of possibilities and select the most promising candidates. This represents a new paradigm for drug development. </p>

<p>In some ways, having computers be creative by exhaustively trying every possibility can be even more powerful than other forms of creativity.</p>

<h2>Challenges in Human Augmentation</h2>

<p>While computers will match human intelligence relatively soon, progress in directly affecting the human body, through things like nanobots and brain-machine interfaces, is happening more slowly. There are valid concerns about potential negative effects that require a cautious approach and human testing.</p>

<p>The goal is to increase human intelligence by marrying the best of what computers can do with our biological brains. This will allow us to overcome the inherent slowness of interacting with external devices like smartphones.</p>

<p>It may be possible to interface with the brain externally without requiring implants, which would sidestep many of the ethical issues. But technologies like nanobots operating inside the brain to extract and input thoughts directly still raise tricky questions around fairness and people gaining talents they didn't earn.</p>

<h2>Ethical Implications of Superintelligent AI</h2>

<p>A one-liter computer using nanotechnology could theoretically match the brainpower of 10 billion humans. This raises some profound ethical implications to grapple with.</p>

<p>In the future, I believe people will excel at different things based more on their interests rather than everyone having exactly equal capacities.</p>

<p>We will also gain the ability for AI to emulate a specific deceased person based on their writings and other information, enabling conversations that match how they would have responded. But again, major ethical questions to consider.</p>

<p>The singularity itself is very hard for us to fully envision right now, like a mouse trying to understand human intelligence. It represents such a vast leap beyond current experience.</p>

<h2>Timeline for Key Milestones</h2>

<p>I believe longevity escape velocity, where we're adding back more than a year per year to lifespans, may be achieved in as little as 5-6 years for those who are really diligent. </p>

<p>Fully emulating the brain and human intelligence may take until more like 2040-2045 in my view.</p>

<h2>Preserving Identity and Individuality</h2>

<p>Even if we gain the ability to share memories or upload our brains to the cloud, I believe we will still remain distinct individuals, albeit with new ways of communicating and potentially creating hybrids if we so choose.</p>

<p>If a person's mind is augmented with computer-based neural connections, and something happens to their biological brain, we could still recreate those computer-based enhancements since they are backed up. By 2045, we may be able to back up the non-mechanical parts of the brain as well.</p>

<h2>Potential Dangers and Historical Parallels</h2>

<p>I'm not blindly optimistic about the potential dangers. Atomic weapons represented an enormous existential risk in the past and still do today. Computers could certainly be involved in dangers in the future as well.</p>

<p>However, I believe that as computers become more intelligent, they will also be able to help us avoid and mitigate potential dangers better than we can on our own.</p>

<h2>Economic and Social Impacts</h2>

<p>Over the past 80-90 years, we've seen computing power increase by a factor of 20 quadrillion while average incomes have multiplied 100-fold. The vast majority of people are living far more prosperous and successful lives now as a result. Global poverty has fallen dramatically.</p>

<p>Throughout history, we've always seen some jobs lost to technological progress, like with the invention of the cotton gin. But overall incomes have gone up and we've created entirely new industries and jobs that didn't exist before. I believe this trend will continue.</p>

<p>My advice to young people would be to focus less on what will make the most money and more on what you are truly passionate about. If people may be able to live for hundreds of years, it doesn't make sense to think about retiring at 65 like in the past.</p>

<h2>Developing Trust in AI Systems</h2>

<p>As AI advances, I believe we will also learn much more about how these systems actually work under the hood. This will ultimately lead to a higher level of trust in computers and AI. They will get better and better at knowing what they don't know and avoiding errors.</p>

<p>There are potential dangers to be aware of, like a scenario where advanced nanotechnology runs amok and starts replicating everything into paper clips. But I believe we will develop the means to detect and prevent these kind of negative outcomes.</p>

<h2>The Human Role in Creating AI</h2>

<p>It's important to remember that we humans, with our unique capabilities like opposable thumbs, are the ones creating all of this technology that is becoming AI. In a sense, AI is really just an extension and distribution of human knowledge and capabilities.</p>

<h2>An Optimistic Vision of the Future</h2>

<p>While I don't have a Pollyanna view, I do believe we are heading into a future where we will live much longer, be far more wealthy, and have significantly more equality. We've already seen dramatic progress in these areas over the past century.</p>

<p>So I'm quite optimistic that the future is very bright indeed as we continue this exponential arc of technological progress and use it to improve the human condition. We have good reason to believe tomorrow will be better than today.</p>
