<h2>Evolution of the Internet and Social Media</h2>

<p>The <strong>transition from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0</strong> marked a significant shift, allowing creators to actively participate on the internet rather than just consume content. This era saw the emergence of platforms like <strong>YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter</strong>, which promoted content creation and sharing. For artists and creators, this was transformative, offering a platform to reach audiences directly.</p>

<p>I began my music career performing in local bars, struggling to gain an audience. Discovering YouTube was a turning point, showing me the potential of the internet to reach people. I started uploading videos of my music, showcasing the recording process in a unique way that wasn't common at the time. My approach to music videos, using simple equipment and genuine passion, began to attract viewers. The <strong>subscribe button</strong> on YouTube was a game-changer, allowing creators to build a following and maintain ongoing communication with their audience. The concept of "following" is foundational to the architecture of human creativity and organization on the internet.</p>

<p>Collaborating with my girlfriend Natalie on a new channel, Pomplamoose, we quickly gained a following, highlighting the power of the subscribe feature. Our experiences with Pomplamoose, from selling grapefruit-scented soap to signing hundreds of thumb drives, demonstrated the direct connection and support from our fans. Booking a show at a laundromat and going viral showed the unconventional and creative ways we engaged with our audience. The journey from playing to empty bars to building a substantial online following illustrates the profound impact of Web 2.0 on creators and artists.</p>

<h2>Personal Journey in Music and Online Creation</h2>

<p>After college in 2007, I started making music and videos, posting them online, a continuation of my lifelong passion for creating. I spent months creating my album "Nightmares and Daydreams" in my childhood bedroom, even crafting the album cover from clay. I began my music career by performing in local bars, <strong>struggling to gain an audience</strong>.</p>

<p>Discovering YouTube was a turning point, showing me the potential of the internet to reach people. I started uploading videos of my music, showcasing the recording process in a unique way that wasn't common at the time. My approach to music videos, using simple equipment and genuine passion, began to attract viewers. The <strong>subscribe button</strong> on YouTube was a game-changer, allowing creators to build a following and maintain ongoing communication with their audience.</p>

<p>Collaborating with my girlfriend Natalie on a new channel, <strong>Pomplamoose</strong>, we quickly gained a following, highlighting the power of the subscribe feature. Our experiences with Pomplamoose, from selling grapefruit-scented soap to signing hundreds of thumb drives, demonstrated the <strong>direct connection and support from our fans</strong>. Booking a show at a laundromat and going viral showed the unconventional and creative ways we engaged with our audience. This journey from playing to empty bars to building a substantial online following illustrates the profound impact of Web 2.0 on creators and artists.</p>

<h2>The Power of the Subscribe Button and True Fans</h2>

<p><strong>Building a following</strong> is crucial for creators. The <strong>subscribe button</strong> on platforms like YouTube changed the game for me, allowing me to maintain ongoing communication with my audience. This concept of "following" is foundational to the architecture of human creativity and organization on the internet.</p>

<p>Kevin Kelly introduced the concept of <strong>"a thousand true fans"</strong>. He argued that success doesn't require millions of fans but rather a small, dedicated group willing to support you financially. This idea resonated with me deeply.</p>

<p>My personal experiences of <strong>deep fan engagement</strong> include fans getting tattoos, creating custom merchandise, and participating in music videos. These actions illustrate the depth of connection with true fans. I've also used e-junkie to sell original music from my website, directly monetizing my music to fans. A unique album promotion involved asking fans to donate books to a school district in exchange for a free album, which resulted in significant contributions. This highlighted the power of leveraging fan support for charitable causes.</p>

<p>The founding of Patreon was inspired by the desire to monetize creative work effectively and the concept of true fans. It's designed to facilitate direct financial support from fans to creators.</p>

<h2>Challenges with Social Media Algorithms</h2>

<p>The <strong>shift towards ranked feeds</strong> on platforms like Facebook, which prioritized content based on engagement, significantly affected creators' visibility and altered the creator-fan relationship. This evolution in the internet and social media, particularly the broader adoption of ranked feeds across major social platforms, framed the 2010s as a decade where the original promise of direct creator-fan connections was undermined.</p>

<p>I've critiqued the impact of <strong>algorithmic changes on creative freedom</strong>, noting how the need to cater to platform algorithms can detract from authentic creative expression. The binary debate between chronological and algorithmic feeds misses the point; what's needed is a balance that supports strong creator-fan relationships without compromising creative integrity.</p>

<p>The emergence of <strong>TikTok</strong> and its profound impact on the social media landscape, with its departure from the subscription model to a curated "For You" feed, challenges traditional engagement models. The response of other platforms to TikTok's success by introducing similar features indicates a shift in the internet ecosystem towards engagement-driven content delivery, further distancing from the concept of direct follower engagement.</p>

<p>Over the last four years, I've noticed a significant decline in the visibility and engagement of my content, making it challenging to sell tickets, reach people with new work, build community, and energize fans. Many creators, including myself, are experiencing a shift in the internet landscape, potentially marking the 2020s as the era of the <strong>"death of the follower"</strong>. A fellow creator shared a distressing experience where changes on Facebook led to an 80% drop in traffic, forcing them to consider selling their home and seeking employment. This issue isn't isolated to individual creators but affects media companies as well, with notable organizations like Vice, BuzzFeed, and Rooster Teeth facing similar challenges.</p>

<p>It's important for creators to recognize that struggling to connect with their audience might not be a personal failure but a broader issue affecting the web, making it difficult for even well-funded media companies to navigate. The weakening of creator-led communities and distribution channels to fans is identified as the most critical problem facing creative individuals on the internet today.</p>

<h2>Emerging Platforms and Direct-to-Fan Connections</h2>

<p>New platforms like <strong>Discord, Kajabi, Fourth Wall, and Gumroad</strong> are emerging, focusing on <strong>direct-to-fan connections</strong> and community strength. This shift in strategy is fundamental, aiming to solve the problem of weakening creator-led communities by fostering deeper connections rather than merely expanding reach.</p>

<p><strong>Patreon</strong> has evolved from a membership platform to take a more holistic approach to solving the challenges faced by creators. It now focuses on <strong>media, community, and business</strong>, developing new tools and products aimed at fostering true fandom. This enables creators to energize their communities and maintain closer connections over time.</p>

<p>The introduction of <strong>Commerce</strong> and <strong>free membership options</strong> on Patreon is designed to accommodate fans not ready for subscription payments, allowing them to still engage with and support creators. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to create a space where art and community can thrive on the internet, moving beyond the limitations of current platforms and strategies.</p>

<p>I've noticed that there are fans who are deeply engaged with creators' content, attending shows and buying merchandise, yet they might not be ready to purchase digital products or subscribe. This observation highlights the <strong>importance of nurturing relationships</strong> with these fans. It's been found that <strong>40 to 50%</strong> of these fans express a strong intention to financially support the creator in the near future, indicating a high potential for conversion into paying supporters.</p>

<p>The acquisition of a live experiences platform called <strong>Moment</strong> has been a significant development. This platform isn't just about ticketed live streaming; it's a more immersive experience allowing creators to sell tickets to live events, fostering a sense of community among fans. The platform has successfully hosted events for notable creators and artists, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating live community experiences.</p>

<p>My vision for the future extends beyond seeing us as merely a membership company. I envision us as a <strong>fan and creator-centric company</strong>, aiming to enhance the relationship between art and community on the internet. I am driven by a deep belief in the potential for an internet where creators have true freedom and control over their careers and businesses, and where being part of a creator community feels invigorating.</p>

<h2>Strategies for Creators Navigating the Changing Landscape</h2>

<p><strong>Investing in true fans</strong> is crucial. It's not about constantly seeking new viewers or subscribers but about deepening connections with a core group of fans who are the engine of your business. There are various ways to build community with your true fans, such as through email lists, Discord, or Patreon. The key is to find and nurture these relationships.</p>

<p>Creators should focus on making beautiful, <strong>meaningful work</strong> rather than content solely designed to please algorithms. This approach can lead to more fulfilling and sustainable creative careers. The metaphor of the hot dog stand under the Eiffel Tower versus a local restaurant illustrates the difference between chasing new customers and building a loyal, engaged community through quality and trust.</p>

<p>Some creators, like those in the YouTube New Wave, have successfully built strong communities around their work by focusing on depth and quality, proving that alternative approaches to content creation can thrive.</p>

<p>One of the hardest lessons I've learned is the importance of knowing and staying true to what I want as a creator, rather than being swayed by external definitions of success. It's essential for creators to <strong>define their own goals and values</strong>, focusing on creating work that resonates deeply with themselves and their audience, rather than chasing metrics like watch time.</p>

<p>As we navigate the evolving internet landscape, it's crucial to remember why we create, what fills us with pride, and what gives our work meaning. This internal compass should guide our creative endeavors.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>In the realm of art and creation, <strong>expressing a unique voice</strong> is paramount. It's what connects us with others and makes our work timeless and impactful. Building a <strong>loyal, engaged community</strong> around this unique voice is essential, as it's not just about reaching a vast audience but connecting deeply with those who truly appreciate your work.</p>

<p>As we look towards the future, navigating <strong>future shifts in the internet landscape</strong> will be crucial. The landscape is ever-changing, and what works today may not work tomorrow. However, by focusing on our artistic purpose and staying true to our unique voice, we can continue to build meaningful connections with our audience, regardless of the platform or medium.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it's vital not to lose sight of our artistic purpose. Boldly expressing our unique voice is what ultimately connects us with others and makes our work timeless and impactful.</p>
