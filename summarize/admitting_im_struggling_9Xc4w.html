<h2>Personal Update and Challenges</h2>

<p>I want to share a more personal update because it's been a while, and I think it's crucial to be real with you all. Despite what it might look like, there are always ups and downs. Recently, I've been facing personal challenges and finding it difficult to keep things fresh and rewarding, especially with the increasing challenges of the platform.</p>

<h2>The Struggle with Content Creation</h2>

<p>Creating content has been particularly tough. I spent hours on a digital drawing that didn't turn out well, which led me to switch to a more rough and scribbly style on paper. This struggle isn't just about the art; it's about how it affects my well-being.</p>

<h2>Sharing Personal Struggles Online</h2>

<p>I have hesitations about opening up like this. I worry about negative reactions from people who might think I have it easy. But I believe everyone's struggles are valid. Sharing personal struggles also affects the image I present online. I'm conscious of how "being real" becomes part of that image, which can lead to people remembering me for my low moments. Striking a balance between being honest about struggles and maintaining a positive image is challenging.</p>

<h2>Visual Framework for Understanding Activities</h2>

<p>My recent coaching session introduced me to a visual framework for understanding activities based on energy use and emotional impact. This framework categorizes activities into <strong>performing</strong>, <strong>surviving</strong>, <strong>recharging</strong>, and <strong>burning out</strong>. I've realized I rarely allow myself to recharge, often operating in performing mode, but lately, I've been more in survival and burnout modes. This has made it clear I need to manage this better.</p>

<h2>Efforts to Move Out of Survival and Burnout</h2>

<p>My current project is to move out of survival and burnout modes, with the support of my coach, therapists, and the positive and compassionate community around me. Gratitude and focusing on enjoying where I'm at and what I've achieved are key to helping me get out of my own head. Despite living my dream job, it's still a job with its imperfections, and I'm working on finding more balance and opportunities to recharge.</p>

<h2>Finding Joy and Balance</h2>

<p>I've been enjoying game development and spending quality time with my wife, like going for a horse ride, as ways to find joy and balance. A major challenge has been learning to find ways to recharge amidst the pressures I put on myself and the responsibilities I have towards my family and my audience. My coaching session also highlighted how much pressure I feel to support my family and provide for the people who work with me, as well as the expectations of my audience.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Being Open About Struggles</h2>

<p>I'm sharing this because I believe it's helpful to be open about these struggles, and there might be someone who needs to hear this message today. It's important to take a deep breath and remember that everything is a moment in time, and we can work towards better moments in the future.</p>
