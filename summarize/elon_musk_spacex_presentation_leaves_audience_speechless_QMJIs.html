<h2>The Question of Alien Life and the Rarity of Consciousness</h2>

<p>When I think about the question of where the aliens are, which I get asked a lot, it's a very profound one. I'm not aware of any evidence of aliens whatsoever, which suggests we may be alone. If you look at the history of Earth, it's been around for about 4.5 billion years, but civilization, as measured by the advent of writing, has only existed for around 5,500 years. That's just a blink of an eye on the cosmic timescale. </p>

<p>Consciousness seems incredibly rare and perhaps fleeting in the universe. It may not last very long because otherwise, I think we would have seen some sign of aliens. If we were able to become a space-faring civilization and explore the stars, we may find many long-dead one-planet civilizations. We don't want to be one of those - we need to become multi-planetary.</p>

<h2>The Urgency of Making Life Multi-Planetary</h2>

<p>This is the first time in Earth's 4.5 billion year history that extending consciousness beyond Earth is possible. We've got to do it while civilization is still strong, ideally before a catastrophic event like World War III or some other bad thing outside of our control. </p>

<p>The overarching goal of SpaceX is to make life multi-planetary by establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars that could survive even if something terrible happened to Earth. I believe this can be done in around 20 years with Starship. The key is getting enough people and cargo to Mars so it can continue even if Earth doesn't.</p>

<h2>Progress and Future Plans for Starship Development</h2>

<p>We've made tremendous progress with Starship from flight 1 to flight 3. It's insane to think the unfiltered camera footage is real and not CGI. Congratulations to the team - you're doing incredible work that almost no one thought would actually happen.</p>

<p>For flight 4, coming up in about a month, we're aiming to get through the high heating regime and have a controlled "landing" in the ocean. Then with flight 5, we may attempt to catch the booster with the launch tower arms. I'm confident, probably 80-90%, that we'll achieve booster catch this year. It sounded crazy at first - catching the biggest flying object ever with robot chopsticks - but we're going to do it.</p>

<p>We're also building more launch towers, with plans for two in Boca Chica and two at Cape Canaveral. This will enable a higher flight rate. Most of the operational launches will likely be from the Cape, while we'll do development launches and build the rockets here in Texas.</p>

<h2>Starship Capabilities and Comparisons to Previous Rockets</h2>

<p>The payload capacity of our rockets has increased dramatically over the years. Falcon 1 could do about half a ton to orbit, Falcon 9 around 25 tons, and Falcon Heavy maybe 70 tons. Starship, in its final form, will do well over 100 tons fully reusable, perhaps over 200 tons, and be able to fly multiple times a day.</p>

<p>Once Starship is operational, SpaceX launches will make up the vast majority of mass sent to orbit from Earth. Starship also opens up the entire solar system - it can take significant payloads anywhere from the Moon to Mars to the moons of Jupiter and beyond.</p>

<h2>Vision and Timeline for Building a City on Mars</h2>

<p>The rough order of magnitude for a self-sustaining city on Mars is about a million people and several million tons of cargo. To get to that scale, we'd need to do around 10 Starship launches per day, each with 200 tons of payload. Over the 2-year Mars transfer window, that adds up to about a quarter million tons sent to Mars per opportunity.</p>

<p>At that rate, we could get a million tons to Mars in about 8 years, since the opportunities are 2 years apart. I think that's pretty doable - we're actually going to do this. It sounds wild, but we will need to build several thousand Starships per year, which is a lot but very achievable compared to car or plane production.</p>

<p>Long-term, the goal is to get the cost per Starship launch down to around $2-3 million. That would make it affordable for almost anyone to go to Mars if they worked hard and saved up. Imagine it - every 2 years, this gigantic fleet of thousands of Starships departing Earth for Mars. It'll look like Battlestar Galactica, but in a good way!</p>

<h2>Infrastructure and Industries Needed for a Self-Sustaining Mars Civilization</h2>

<p>For early missions, we'd probably just use the Starships themselves for raw materials on Mars. But to be truly self-sustaining and enable return trips, we need to produce methane and oxygen propellant locally. Thankfully, the ingredients of water ice and atmospheric CO2 are readily available on Mars - that's actually why we chose a methane-fueled rocket.</p>

<p>But a full-fledged city will require a wide range of other infrastructure and industries too:</p>

<ul>

<li>Reliable power generation, probably solar and hopefully nuclear</li>

<li>Mining and resource extraction </li>

<li>Construction for habitats and industrial facilities</li>

<li>Closed-loop life support systems</li>

<li>Global communications network</li>

<li>And many other things we take for granted on Earth</li>

</ul>

<p>This will open up tremendous opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs on Mars. You could start a propellant depot, a metal refinery, a pizzeria, a bar - the first Mars bar! There will be a chance to do all the things we like on Earth, on Mars.</p>

<hr />

<p>So in conclusion, I believe it's crucial for the future of consciousness that we become a multi-planetary species as soon as possible. It won't be easy, but we're actually going to do it. If you think about how far we've come, from basically just a sandbar here in Boca Chica to flying the largest rocket ever made, it's surreal but it's real. </p>

<p>We're going to take humanity to Mars, and I'm confident we can do it within the next couple decades. It's going to be an incredible adventure and open up endless possibilities for life and consciousness to flourish in our solar system and beyond. Let's make science fiction a reality and build an exciting future we can all look forward to. Thank you.</p>
