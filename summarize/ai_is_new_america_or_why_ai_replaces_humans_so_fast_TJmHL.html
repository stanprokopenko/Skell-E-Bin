<h2>Impact of AI on Professions</h2>

<p>The rapid advancement of AI technology is reshaping the job landscape in profound ways. <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, for instance, achieved a user milestone in just 5 days, a feat that took Instagram and Netflix much longer, underscoring the explosive growth of AI. This growth is not without its consequences, particularly in the realm of coding. NVIDIA's introduction of an <strong>AI-created programming language</strong> has fundamentally altered the coding profession, rendering it incomprehensible to human coders and signaling a shift towards AI-driven software development. This shift is particularly impactful for junior coders and those who entered the field due to political encouragement, challenging the long-held belief in the indispensability of learning to code. Moreover, AI's advancement is democratizing programming, effectively turning every user into a programmer. This trend extends beyond coding, as white-collar professions like finance, law, HR, and consulting are experiencing layoffs and a diminishing need for human professionals, thanks to AI adoption.</p>

<h2>Evolution and Acceleration of AI Technology</h2>

<p>The pace at which AI technology is evolving and being adopted is unprecedented, likened to a phase shift or historical technological revolutions, but occurring much faster. This evolution can be traced back to the survival mechanisms of prehistoric bacteria and the natural selection process, leading to the development of complex neural networks in humans. These networks, with their 100 trillion neural connections, undergo extensive training from birth, a process mirrored in the training of artificial neural networks. However, the training of these networks faces significant challenges due to the inefficiencies of traditional computing architecture, where the processor spends most of its time waiting for data to travel from memory. This inefficiency has historically made AI development slow and expensive, with even the simplest AI systems taking months to train on the largest supercomputers.</p>

<h2>Significance of GPUs in AI Development</h2>

<p>The demand for faster computing, largely driven by gamers' dissatisfaction with slow game performance, led to the development of the <strong>Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)</strong>. NVIDIA's introduction of the GPU, which breaks down computational tasks into smaller parts to be handled simultaneously by multiple processors, marked a pivotal moment in AI development. This was exemplified when a team from the University of Toronto used two GPUs for the ImageNet Challenge, significantly outperforming previous models in accuracy. The success of this GPU-driven deep learning model revealed that GPUs, originally designed for gaming, were highly effective for AI computations. This discovery was a serendipity, an unexpected discovery with profound impacts, akin to the Big Bang, penicillin, Viagra, and the discovery of America.</p>

<h2>Serendipity and Societal Implications</h2>

<p>The role of serendipities in scientific advancement cannot be overstated, often leading to sudden, significant leaps in knowledge and technology. AI's transformative power is evident in its ability to solve long-standing problems, such as the prevention of bedsores in healthcare, and in replacing professions that rely on human vision, like driverless cabs and workerless factories. The unintentional discovery of AI's capabilities marks a significant serendipity in human history, with the potential to transform industries and society at large. A personal anecdote about the author's proximity to the birthplace of AI at the University of Toronto underscores the unpredictability and significance of such discoveries.</p>

<h2>Observations and Lessons</h2>

<p>The key lesson from these observations is the importance of being observant and open-minded to recognize significant advancements and opportunities. The most intriguing activities are often happening right before our eyes, and it's crucial for us to recognize these events. This mindset is essential as we navigate the ongoing AI revolution, which promises to reshape our world in ways we are only beginning to understand.</p>
