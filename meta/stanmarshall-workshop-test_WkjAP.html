<h2>Course Overview and Progress</h2>

<p>We've invested two months of diligent work on foundational skills, completing the Form Foundations section of our course. As we move forward, we're transitioning to Plans and Proximity, with about three months left in the course. Our focus is shifting from basic skills to more advanced concepts and practical applications.</p>

<h2>Foundational Drawing Skills</h2>

<h3>Cubes and Perspective</h3>

<p>We've been experimenting with cameras and wide-angle close-ups, which has presented unique challenges, especially in 90-degree turn studies. These wide-angle perspectives can be particularly tricky due to the distortion of Z and X lines on the floor. To help with these studies, we've found that <strong>using a compass can be beneficial</strong>.</p>

<h3>Ellipses and Circles</h3>

<p>Drawing accurate ellipses remains a significant challenge for many of us. We often find ourselves 2-5% off despite careful efforts. However, it's crucial to remember that ellipses are vital in establishing rounded forms. The <strong>placement of ellipses in perspective</strong> is particularly complex, comparable to the strictness of a music teacher monitoring piano fingering.</p>

<h3>Grid Drawing</h3>

<p>Our current assignment involves drawing grids freehand and using them to create boxes, cylinders, or cartoon characters. Wide-angle grids can be especially confusing due to extreme distortion. This exercise helps us understand how forms interact with space and perspective.</p>

<h2>Cartoon Drawing Techniques</h2>

<h3>Exaggeration and Style</h3>

<p>In cartoon drawing, <strong>exaggeration is key</strong>. We're encouraged to push our exaggeration further and fight the tendency to rein it in. As Gerald Scarfe aptly put it, "Caricaturing is like stretching chewing gum. You stretch it until it sags, then back up just from that point." William Blake's perspective also resonates here: "You can't know the limits until you've pushed beyond them."</p>

<h3>Character Design</h3>

<p>Changing proportions of characters can lead to interesting variations, like seeing different animals in human forms. We've been exploring how bird wings and feathers can be used to demonstrate convex and concave forms. We've also touched on dog anatomy for cartoonists, which helps in creating more believable animal characters.</p>

<h3>Environment and Space</h3>

<p>We're learning to imply environments through character poses. Floors, walls, and ceilings are typical tools for tracking environmental space, even in outdoor settings. We're experimenting with two approaches: drawing characters first and implying an environment, or creating environments first and then populating them with characters.</p>

<h2>Advanced Drawing Concepts</h2>

<h3>Wide-Angle Perspective</h3>

<p>Wide-angle lenses can create unique effects, such as objects appearing to crawl out of the frame when close to the camera. We're grappling with the conflict between leg thickening from foot to thigh and the diminution of wide-angle perspective. Understanding and managing these distortions is crucial for creating compelling wide-angle drawings.</p>

<h3>Drapery and Folds</h3>

<p>We're approaching drapery as an extension of anatomy. It's important to dare to exaggerate when studying folds and drapery, as this can lead to more dynamic and interesting results.</p>

<h3>Technical Drawing</h3>

<p>We've been referencing mechanical drawing textbooks for insights on complex intersections and forms. The concept of auxiliary views in technical drawing has been particularly enlightening. We're realizing that accurately drawing intersecting shapes can be as complex as understanding the organic wobble in human eye structures.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications</h2>

<h3>Studio Design</h3>

<p>We're now moving into creating "grown-up" drawings of studio designs. This process involves measuring space efficiently using five specific methods. Our goal is to create "cool things" in the studio while balancing creativity with technical aspects.</p>

<h3>Animation Principles</h3>

<p>We're incorporating skill development for animating motion into our studio designs. Studying classic cartoon styles from the 1930s (Disney, Warner Bros, etc.) provides strong fundamentals in shape, form, and animation principles. Quick thumbnail sketches in sketchbooks are proving useful for exploring ideas and practicing motion.</p>

<h2>Artistic Development</h2>

<h3>Personal Style</h3>

<p>We're exploring the development of personal style, using examples like Jessica Huynh, who experimented with different shape languages. We're emphasizing the importance of versatility in artistic style, comparing it to musicians being able to play different genres.</p>

<h3>Professional Practices</h3>

<p>We've discussed the importance of consulting professionals or experts in specific fields when needed. Constant redrawing, planning, and experimenting are necessary to achieve natural and appealing poses. We're also working on developing the skill to draw precise lines in one stroke, which requires decision and rapid action.</p>

<p>As we continue our journey, remember that experimentation and not being too concerned with correctness is important in cartoon drawing. Keep pushing your boundaries, and don't be afraid to exaggerate and play with your art.</p>
