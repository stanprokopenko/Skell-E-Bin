<p>I'm Zach, and today, we're diving into <strong>hope</strong> and its essential role in art making. Inspired by Reys Rooper's quote, "the bravest thing of all is always hope," we'll explore how hope is not just a feeling but a brave act, especially in the context of creating art.</p>

<h2>Understanding Hope</h2>

<p><strong>Hope</strong> functions as both a <strong>noun</strong> and a <strong>verb</strong>, embodying a desire accompanied by an expectation of fulfillment. It's a complex concept, yet we have an innate understanding of its importance in our lives and creative processes.</p>

<h2>Hope's Role in Art</h2>

<h3>The Relationship Between Hope and the Artist</h3>

<p>In my experience, <strong>hope is intrinsic to art making</strong>. It's not just a crucial component; its absence is profoundly felt. Art requires bravery, and hope embodies this by allowing us to believe in the possibility of achieving our desires. Every blank page or canvas is a testament to hope – the hope to learn, refine a skill, or create something great.</p>

<h3>The Natural Assumptions of Hope in Art</h3>

<p>Hope inherently assumes that <strong>beauty exists</strong> and is worth pursuing. It encourages us to try new things, to step into the unknown with the belief that something beautiful can emerge. This belief in beauty's existence and the pursuit of it is fundamental to the creative process.</p>

<h2>Personal Reflections on Hope</h2>

<p>Personally, hope has been a challenging concept. I tend to expect little to avoid disappointment, a strategy that, while protective, often limits my ability to find joy and excitement in the future. Recognizing the importance of hope, I'm learning to embrace it, despite the risks, because without it, the potential for success in any artistic endeavor is significantly diminished.</p>

<h2>Strategies for Fostering Hope in Art</h2>

<h3>Utilizing Sketchbooks</h3>

<p>I've found maintaining two types of sketchbooks – one for experimentation ("ugly" sketchbook) and one for more refined work ("pretty" sketchbook) – helps balance the need for exploration and the desire for creating presentable art. This approach allows for a safe space to play and a focused environment for serious work, fostering hope through both freedom and discipline.</p>

<h3>Overcoming Hopelessness</h3>

<p>If you're feeling hopeless about your art, take a step back. Examine your past work for growth and areas of interest. Remember, if you believe all your work is terrible, you're likely wrong and might benefit from outside perspective. Our Discord community offers support and critique for artists at all levels.</p>

<h2>The Journey of Learning Art</h2>

<p>Learning art is a long-term commitment. It requires patience, persistence, and, most importantly, hope. The belief that improvement and success are possible fuels the journey, making the challenges and time investment worthwhile.</p>

<h2>The Philosophical Implications of Hope</h2>

<h3>Assumptions Made by Hoping</h3>

<p>Hope assumes that beauty is not only real but essential to our lives. It believes in the importance of depicting beauty and that both artists and viewers deserve to experience it. This belief underscores the transformative power of art in conveying beauty and emotion.</p>

<h3>Hope as a Human Endeavor</h3>

<p>Art is a fundamental aspect of human civilization, reflecting our innate need to create and appreciate beauty. As artists, we have the responsibility to bring beauty into the world, a task that enriches humanity and makes life more fulfilling.</p>

<p>Embracing hope in art and life is a brave choice. It opens us to the possibility of disappointment but also to the potential for great joy and success. I encourage you to let hope guide your creative journey, to take risks, and to believe in the beauty of what you can create.
