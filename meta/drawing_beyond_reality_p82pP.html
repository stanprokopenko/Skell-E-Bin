<p>I've been delving into the concept of <strong>manipulating and distorting figures</strong>, transitioning from human figures to non-human subjects to push the boundaries of logical thinking. To illustrate this, I chose a <strong>classic car from the 1920s or 1930s</strong> as my base sketch, aiming to demonstrate a potential angle of view.</p>

<h2>Drawing Process</h2>

<h3>Base Sketch and Manipulation</h3>

<p>The process began with sketching the car from a <strong>three-quarter angle view</strong>, focusing on details like <strong>fenders, wheels, and the windshield</strong>. I then manipulated the sketch by <strong>twisting and stretching</strong> elements such as the front grill, wheels, and windshield. This manipulation was aimed at making the drawing visually more interesting and beyond the realm of reality, allowing for the expression of <strong>action, story, movement, and energy</strong> in a way that captures something more intensive than what is seen in reality.</p>

<h3>Balance Between Observation and Free Drawing</h3>

<p>I discussed the balance between <strong>drawing from observation</strong> to build a visual vocabulary and <strong>drawing freely for fun</strong>, emphasizing the importance of both approaches in my practice. Drawing subjects I'm familiar with, like vehicles or animals, allows me to transfer knowledge from one archetype to another, using my experience to draw new subjects by adjusting proportions and scales based on my understanding of basic structures.</p>

<h3>Familiarity with Subject Matter</h3>

<p>My ability to draw freely and expressively without much thought comes from my <strong>familiarity with the subject matter</strong>, which also contributes to the <strong>speed of my drawing process</strong>.</p>

<h2>Designing Shadow Shapes</h2>

<p>When designing shadow shapes, I explained that it's a mix of <strong>adhering to reality and aesthetic choices</strong>, and the importance of deciding on an approach from the start for consistency.</p>

<h2>When to Start Over</h2>

<p>I shared insights into when I decide to <strong>start over on a piece</strong>, particularly when <strong>proportions are off</strong>, and the importance of accurate proportions in studies.</p>

<h2>Transition to Brush Pen Work</h2>

<p>My transition from pencil to brush pen work was a matter of <strong>playing with the tool</strong> and building confidence through <strong>repetition and familiarity</strong> with the subject matter and the tool itself.</p>

<h2>Influence of Kim Jung Gi and Superani</h2>

<p>Meeting <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> and joining the collective <strong>Superani</strong> influenced my work through communal sharing of ideas and techniques, even though we were initially influenced by similar artists.</p>

<h2>Aim and Expression in Drawings</h2>

<p>I aim to express <strong>dynamics of action, movement, and emotion</strong> in my drawings, moving beyond logical representation to explore expressive possibilities. I value every sketch as a <strong>learning and experiential opportunity</strong>.</p>
