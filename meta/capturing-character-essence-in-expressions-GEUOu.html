<h2>Drawing Storm's Expressions</h2>

<p>When drawing Storm, start with a circle and add the jaw. To indicate it's a woman, give her a slimmer neck and round ears. Storm has high cheekbones and a small nose, which contribute to her regal and beautiful expressions. Her features are stylized but not exactly African. She has long hair and a size two or double zero body.</p>

<p>When using her powers, her eyes go completely white. Drawing people of color involves changing the head shape, wider cheekbones, and a flatter nose. However, Storm's face retains a narrow skull, which is a common issue in drawing characters of African descent. Her features include high cheekbones, full lips, and a pointy chin. Her eyebrows can be flared or natural.</p>

<p>Storm's expressions are always beautiful and never jokey. She lacks micro-expressions and can't tell side jokes. Her mouth is often closed, avoiding aeiou lip formations. While she can cry, she doesn't wail. Female characters generally have rounder chins and egg-shaped faces, and eyebrows are crucial for expressions. Storm's expressions range from gentle smiles to slight disgust, with extreme expressions being rare.</p>

<h2>Drawing Moon Girl's Expressions</h2>

<p>Drawing children like Moon Girl is more fun due to their elastic and expressive faces. Kids' heads change as they grow, with large eyes and chubby cheeks. Moon Girl has exaggerated features and cartoony proportions. Her glasses follow the face's center line.</p>

<p>Expressions involve the whole face and body language. Mischievous looks are achieved with specific mouth and eye positions. Moon Girl's expressions are varied and fun to draw. Eyebrows are key to changing expressions. Luna's design allows for frequent hairstyle changes without losing her identity.</p>

<h2>Personal Experiences and Techniques</h2>

<p>My initial art career involved painting album covers for death metal bands. My family moved from Honduras to Florida. Creating thumbnails involves laying out panels and understanding character actions. Dialogue placement follows the 180 rule, like a stage play. Adjustments may be needed if speakers switch sides in the dialogue. Trust between artist and editor is built over time through consistent storytelling.</p>
