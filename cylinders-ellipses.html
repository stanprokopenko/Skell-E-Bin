<h1>Is Perspective Real?</h1>

<div class="container">
  
<p>Hey, welcome back. We’ve been drawing a lot of boxes, and now we’re moving on cylinders. Which, funny enough, also involves boxes.</p>
<p>Cylinders are really important to learn because a lot of things are cylindrical. Arms, legs, car tires, whoopie cushions. Eh, kind of.. When it’s flattened it’s basically an oval. Or is it an ellipse?</p>
<h2>Ovals vs ellipses</h2>
<p>A lot of people seem to be confused about the difference between the two, so let’s get that out of the way..</p>
<p>All ellipses are ovals. But not all ovals are ellipses. An egg-like oval is not an ellipse. Ellipses must have 4 equal quadrants.</p>
<p>If you can’t remember, you can just say oval, and you’ll be right. If you want to be specific, you can call it an ellipse if it passes the fold test. If you fold the ellipse along this longest part, and then again perpendicular to it, you can see that the 4 quadrants align perfectly. </p>
<p>And by the way, that longest line is called the <strong>major axis</strong>. And the short line perpendicular to it is the <strong>minor axis</strong>. You’ll probably hear me also using the terms long and short axis. Same thing..</p>
<p>When we're talking about ellipses in the context of perspective drawing we're referring to circles tilted in 3D space. They’re <strong>foreshortened circles</strong>. As I tilt it more and more, it gets foreshortened until it becomes a line. Just like a plane of a box would.</p>
<p>When we look at a circle from straight on, we see a perfect circle and the axes cross right in the middle. When we tilt the circle, it becomes an ellipse, but the long axis doesn't cross the center of the circle! This makes sense because the closer half appears bigger than the farther half, while the ellipse stays symmetrical 2-dimensionally. Don’t try to draw one of these weirdo trapezoid ovals that don't pass the fold test. Cause that oval, that’s not an ellipse..</p>
<p>The minor axis is much more helpful in constructing ellipses and cylinders. It always crosses the center point, and it points directly at the perpendicular vanishing point. I’ll show you what that means in a minute.</p>
<h2>Stacking Ellipses</h2>
<p>An ellipse is flat. But a cylinder is not. A cylinder is basically a stack of ellipses. You’ll sometimes see artists drawing <strong>cross contour</strong> curves around a cylindrical form, like an arm or a leg. We’re thinking about what the ellipse looks like at that cross section of the cylinder. When we're drawing a cylinder we don't need to think of the ellipse at each cross section, but we at least need the two ends. The angle of the minor axis tells us where the stacking ellipses should go.</p>
<p>[IMAGE OF BARBELL WITH ALL THE LINES]</p>
<p>Let’s head over to the gym for a second. Notice how the ellipse of the plate on this barbell isn’t vertical. It’s angled slightly, such that the minor axis is perfectly aligned with the bar. The minor axis also happens to be the Z axis leading to the vanishing point. The same goes for wheels on a car. Unless the wheels are turning. Then, not.. </p>
<p>On the other end of the barbell the minor and major axes will be the same. Then we just grab the ellipse from this side, move it over here and.. Hmm.. Looks like the ellipse gets wider as it moves away from us because we’re seeing that circle plane more straight on. To figure out exactly how much wider, we’re gonna need a box..</p>
<h2>Drawing a Cylinder in a Box</h2>
<p>It might be easier to draw a box in perspective and then fit a cylinder in it. Or not.. They're both hard! But it’s gonna help us understand what’s going on. And with practice it’ll become more intuitive. Remember this course isn't about making it perfectly accurate. In Marshall Vandruff's upcoming perspective course, he'll get more precise.</p>
<p>Try drawing a circle inside of a square. Now when you tilt this in any direction, the square foreshortens and the edges converge. All that fun stuff we already learned.. The circle stays tightly inside of the square. It’s not going anywhere. And in order to stay tightly inside of that square it needs to get wider and narrower and tilt in certain angles.</p>
<p>To begin, I draw a box in perspective, keeping it as close to a square plane as possible. To fit an ellipse inside the square plane, look for a few key clues:</p>
<ol>
<li>A circle inside a square always touches the square at the middle of every edge, creating four points of contact. To find the exact midpoints, I use the <strong>X method</strong>. The intersection of the X helps us find the centers of all the edges.</li>
<li>The minor axis is at the same angle as the receding lines of the box and crosses the center point.</li>
<li>The major axis is perpendicular to the minor axis. It doesn't pass through the exact center of the square; it's slightly farther away due to foreshortening.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the midpoints and axes in place, I lightly sketch the ellipse, ensuring it touches the four midpoints and follows the major and minor axes.</p>
<p>Next, find the other end of the box and the ellipse inside it following the same clues.</p>
<p>Notice how the farther back the square, the more it will appear as a perfect square rather than a squished diamond. Also, the back ellipse will be flatter, wider, and shorter compared to the front ellipse due to perspective.</p>
<p>[FINISHED DRAWING OF CYLINDER IN BOX]</p>
<h2>Sketching Cylinders</h2>
<p>So, do we have to draw a box every time we want to draw a cylinder? NO! But I had to show you that so you understand how it works and when you’re drawing something like the wheels on a car, you know how to construct it. </p>
<p>When you're sketching something and you don't have to be perfect just remember three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The angle of the ellipse is perpendicular to the length of the cylinder.</li>
<li>The farther end will have a wider ellipse. Practice and get a feel for how much.</li>
<li>The sides will converge slightly as they move away.</li>
</ol>
