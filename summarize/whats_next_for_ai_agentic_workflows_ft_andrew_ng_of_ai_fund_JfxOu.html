<h2>Andrew Ng's Contributions to Computer Science</h2>

<p>Andrew Ng has made significant contributions to computer science, including his pioneering work on <strong>neural networks with GPUs</strong>, founding <strong>Coursera</strong>, and leading the <strong>Google Brain</strong> project. His role as an educator has also been impactful, as humorously noted by a speaker inquiring about a grade from 10 years ago.</p>

<p>AI agents represent a crucial trend in AI development, marking a shift from <strong>non-agentic</strong> to <strong>agentic workflows</strong> in utilizing language models (LMs).</p>

<h3>Non-Agentic Workflows</h3>

<p>Non-agentic workflows are characterized by a simple <strong>prompt-response mechanism</strong>, similar to writing an essay without any revisions. This approach is straightforward but lacks depth and refinement.</p>

<h3>Agentic Workflows</h3>

<p>Agentic workflows, on the other hand, involve <strong>iterative processes</strong> where an AI might draft, research, revise, and improve its output. This method can lead to significantly better results. A case study using the <strong>HumanEval Benchmark</strong> from OpenAI demonstrated that agentic workflows could enhance the performance of LMs like <strong>GPT-3.5</strong>, even outperforming newer models like <strong>GPT-4</strong> in certain tasks.</p>

<h2>Design Patterns in AI Agents</h2>

<p>The broader design patterns in AI agents include <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>planning</strong>, and <strong>multi-agent collaboration</strong>. These patterns vary in their levels of maturity and reliability but offer practical applications.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>Reflection involves prompting an LM to review and improve its own output. This process can lead to enhanced results through iterative feedback and adjustments.</p>

<h3>Planning and Multi-Agent Collaboration</h3>

<p>Planning and multi-agent collaboration are emerging areas with promising results. Examples include using a single LM as both a coder and a critic agent to improve code quality through self-review and external critique. However, these areas currently lack the reliability of more established methods like reflection.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications and Case Studies</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tool Usage</strong>: Initially, much work in utilizing AI tools originated in the computer vision community. The concept of "2 use" expands what an LM can do by incorporating functions that allow it to interact with images and possibly other non-textual data.</li>

<li><strong>Planning Algorithms</strong>: These algorithms can surprise people with their capabilities, similar to the astonishment many experienced with ChatGPT.</li>

<li><strong>AI Agents in Action</strong>: Examples include AI agents autonomously navigating around failures during live demos and generating images where gender roles in a scenario are swapped.</li>

<li><strong>Multi-Agent Collaboration</strong>: Projects like Chat Dev demonstrate the potential of multi-agent systems in complex problem-solving, such as collaboratively developing software.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Future Potential and Cultural Shifts</h2>

<p>The incorporation of AI agent design patterns into development workflows holds the potential for significant productivity gains. A cultural shift is required to adapt to agent workflows, moving from expecting immediate responses to being patient for minutes or hours. <strong>Fast token generation</strong> is crucial for agentic workflows, allowing for rapid iteration over tasks. The anticipation for future models like <strong>Cloud 5, CL 4, GB5, and Gemini 2.0</strong> suggests that agentic reasoning might bring us closer to the performance of these advanced models even on current technology. Agentic workflows are viewed as a step forward in the journey towards <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong>.</p>
