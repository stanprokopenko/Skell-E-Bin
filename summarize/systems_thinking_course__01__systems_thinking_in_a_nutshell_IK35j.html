<p>Systems thinking is the art and discipline of understanding and influencing systems. It can be divided into two primary domains: extroverted (attention focused outwardly) and introverted (attention focused inwardly). In this article, we will explore the key concepts and skills associated with both domains.</p>

<h2>Extroverted Systems Thinking</h2>

<p>Extroverted systems thinking focuses on five main pillars: people, communication, measurements, outcomes, and networks.</p>

<h3>People</h3>

<p>Systems thinking is first and foremost people thinking, as all systems are built for and by humans. It's crucial to understand that humans are emotional creatures, with emotions predating rational thought by hundreds of millions of years. Social status is also central to understanding how humans work, as it serves as a proxy for biological imperatives like food and reproductive success. Developing rapport and connecting with people emotionally is essential for influencing and understanding systems.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Communication is the best way to understand and influence people, and therefore systems. The four key areas of communication are verbal, written, non-verbal, and digital, with listening being the most important part. As a systems thinker, you should take in much more information than you put out, at a ratio of around 6:1 or 8:1. Conversation is a powerful learning tool that we evolved to use, so stretch yourself and focus on modalities where you're weaker.</p>

<h3>Measurements</h3>

<p>If you can't measure something, you can't change it. Key concepts in this area include KPIs, quantitative vs qualitative data, complex multivariate measurements, and the differences between measurements, calculations/theory, and experimentation. Studying and understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively influencing systems.</p>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>

<p>Focus on the objective, empirical outcomes and results of your actions and behaviors. Practice thinking ahead, creating hypotheses, making empirical observations, measuring the differential between expected and actual results, analyzing the results, and integrating them into a feedback loop. This process will help you better understand and influence the systems you're working with.</p>

<h3>Networks</h3>

<p>A network (or system) is a collection of nodes/entities bound by relationships/linkages and constrained by a boundary. Nodes/entities are anything constrained within the system, while relationships/linkages are typically physical, energetic, informational, or temporal connections between nodes. System boundaries can be rigid/fixed, porous, or nebulous, and many systems are layered/hierarchical with internal structure. Systems can also be intersectional, with overlapping boundaries.</p>

<h2>Introverted Systems Thinking</h2>

<p>Introverted systems thinking involves training your own mind, divided into thinking with structure, clarity, and purpose.</p>

<h3>Thinking with Structure</h3>

<p>Thinking with structure revolves around cognitive control - formatting and controlling what your brain is doing. <strong>Thought stopping</strong> is a key skill, using meditation to exercise inhibition (the brakes) in your brain. Inhibition and excitation are the two primary energy dispositions in the brain, and thought stopping allows you to get better steering. <strong>Task set</strong> (often called working memory) is another important concept, referring to all the different mental materials (memories, context, techniques, etc.) used to achieve things. <strong>Schemas</strong> are mental models for things, connected semantically to other memories and knowledge. Practicing schemas brings more structure to the mind and thinking.</p>

<h3>Thinking with Clarity</h3>

<p>Thinking with clarity is about distilling the signal-to-noise ratio, as brains are intrinsically noisy. <strong>Distillation</strong> is the iterative process of purifying, refining, and crystallizing concepts, ideas, beliefs, etc., to assert them as clearly as possible. It is the single most important cognitive skill in systems thinking. <strong>Cognitive dissonance</strong> is the brain's ability to recognize when two or more things are incompatible, signaling that you don't fully understand what's going on and haven't reached maximum clarity or distillation. As a systems thinker, always honor cognitive dissonance and work on reconciling internal incongruities. <strong>Discernment</strong> is the ability to quickly sift through information and identify what is pertinent from what is irrelevant.</p>

<h3>Thinking with Purpose</h3>

<p>Thinking with purpose is different from the outcomes of the extroverted model of systems thinking. While outcomes are about the objective results of actions, behaviors, and decisions, thinking with purpose is about handling focus internally. Systems thinkers should have a way they are trying to reshape the world with their practice and discipline, serving as a guiding North Star. <strong>Leverage points</strong> in systems allow one change to have huge knock-on effects, and identifying the keystone or primary leverage point can get most of the desired results. Your <strong>mission</strong> is your purpose in life and why you are doing the things you're doing. Keeping your mission front and center gives more focus and helps slot in everything you're learning in service to that larger purpose. <strong>Passion</strong> is the affective emotional state driving your energy to learn and be a systems thinker.</p>

<p>By understanding and applying these concepts from both the extroverted and introverted domains of systems thinking, you can become a more effective systems thinker and influencer. Remember to continually practice and refine your skills, and always keep your mission and passion at the forefront of your work.</p>
