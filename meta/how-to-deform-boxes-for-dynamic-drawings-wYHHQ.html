<p><strong>Perspective doesn't have to be static and boring.</strong> You can add gesture to your perspective by deforming boxes to make them feel more dynamic. This technique is useful in two main scenarios: drawing organic forms like the human body and drawing inorganic forms like buildings or cars.</p>

<h2>Curving</h2>

<p><strong>Curving a box</strong> can make it feel like it's moving or soft. Imagine drawing the front plane of a box and curving the lines instead of keeping them straight. This method can be applied to organic forms like arms, torsos, and animals. </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Example:</strong> Draw a front plane of a box and curve the lines to connect the corners. This creates a box with a C curve gesture.</li>

<li><strong>Application:</strong> Use subtle curves for a slight personality or exaggerated curves for a more dynamic effect.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Bloating</h2>

<p><strong>Bloating a box</strong> involves expanding all sides as if filling it with air. This makes the box feel fuller and more dynamic.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Example:</strong> Inflate a box so that all sides curve outward.</li>

<li><strong>Application:</strong> This technique can be used to add volume and personality to various forms.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Imploding</h2>

<p><strong>Imploding a box</strong> means sucking air out of it, curving the lines inward to create a sharp, rigid form. This can make the form feel dangerous or villainous.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Example:</strong> Curve the lines inward to create a box that feels sharp and rigid.</li>

<li><strong>Application:</strong> Use this technique for character design, especially for villains, to give them a more menacing appearance.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tapering</h2>

<p><strong>Tapering a box</strong> involves making it thicker or thinner on one side. This can add weight or imbalance to the form.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Example:</strong> Make a box heavier at the bottom by tapering the lines.</li>

<li><strong>Application:</strong> Use tapering for body parts like forearms and legs, where the form naturally gets thinner or thicker.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Twisting</h2>

<p><strong>Twisting a box</strong> is especially useful for drawing torsos. Visualize the top and bottom planes of the box at different angles and connect them with curved lines.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Example:</strong> Draw the top plane facing one direction and the bottom plane facing another, then connect them.</li>

<li><strong>Application:</strong> This technique is great for drawing torsos and can be combined with other deformations for more complex forms.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Leaning</h2>

<p><strong>Leaning boxes</strong> can add personality and motion to your drawings. Tilt the box slightly to give it a dynamic feel.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Example:</strong> Tilt a chimney on a roof to give the house more character.</li>

<li><strong>Application:</strong> This technique can be used for both organic and inorganic forms to add a sense of motion and personality.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Combining Deformations</h2>

<p><strong>Combining all these methods</strong> can create highly dynamic and interesting forms. For example, you can draw a dog house with various deformations to make it look fun and lively.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Example:</strong> Start with a basic shape and apply curving, bloating, imploding, tapering, and twisting to different parts of the form.</li>

<li><strong>Application:</strong> Use these techniques to balance perspective rules with creative deformations, enhancing the visual effect.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Play with shapes and forms</strong> to make your drawings more dynamic and fun. By using these deformation techniques, you can transform static boxes into lively, interesting forms. Have fun with it, and see how these methods can bring your drawings to life!</p>
