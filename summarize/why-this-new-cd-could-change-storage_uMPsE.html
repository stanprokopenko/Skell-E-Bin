<p>In the late 1970s, we at Phillips were working on something revolutionary - the compact disc. It was a futuristic concept at the time, using laser technology to read stored information. Our initial focus was on video disc technology, but we saw a golden opportunity in the audio market. We aimed to create a smaller, more portable disc that could hold at least an hour of music. This led to the development of our Audio Long Play (ALP) system.</p>

<p>We chose the name "compact disc" to evoke the success of the compact cassette. In March 1979, we showcased the CD's superior audio quality. However, we realized we lacked expertise in digital audio recording. That's when we turned to Sony for help.</p>

<p><strong>Sony and Phillips: A Powerful Collaboration</strong></p>

<p>Sony had experience in digital audio circuitry but lacked expertise in creating physical compact discs. It was a perfect match. We combined our strengths - our engineers developed the laser reading technology, while Sony focused on analog-to-digital circuitry and error correction.</p>

<p>In 1980, we produced The Red Book, establishing standards for compact discs. This collaboration led to the introduction of the first production CD player by Phillips in April 1982. Sony's CDP-101 player debuted in Japan in October 1982, priced at around $2,300 in today's currency.</p>

<p><strong>The Rise of CD Technology</strong></p>

<p>Initially, US record labels were skeptical about CDs. But by 1983, 1,000 different CD titles were available. Dire Straits' "Brothers in Arms" became the first CD to sell over a million copies in 1985. The technology took off rapidly. By 1988, 400 million CDs were produced by 50 pressing plants worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>Peak and Decline</strong></p>

<p>Global CD sales peaked in 2000 at a staggering 2.45 billion. However, the rise of file sharing and MP3 players led to a sharp decline. CD sales nearly halved between 2000 and 2007. By 2021, sales had dropped by 95% since their peak. A brief resurgence occurred in 2021 due to major artists, but the overall trend remains downward.</p>

<p><strong>The Next Generation: 3D Optical Disc</strong></p>

<p>Just when we thought optical discs were becoming obsolete, researchers at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology have developed a groundbreaking 3D optical disc. This new disc boasts an incredible 1.6 petabytes of storage capacity - equivalent to over 200,000 DVDs or 6 billion web pages!</p>

<p><strong>Technical Innovations</strong></p>

<p>The massive storage is achieved through layering, with 100 layers of data storage. The researchers created a new material called aggregation-induced emission di-doped photoresist (AIE-DDPR). This advanced material allows light to pass through with minimal scattering.</p>

<p>Data is recorded in sections as small as 1/10th the wavelength of visible light. A green laser triggers spot formation, while a red laser switches off the writing process. Reading data involves a blue beam making spots glow and an orange light turning off the glow. The disc's 100 layers are spaced just a micrometer apart.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Applications</strong></p>

<p>These new discs are well-suited for data centers, potentially storing exabytes of data in a small space. Optical discs are known for their longevity, durability, and robustness against electromagnetic interference. A 100 terabyte disc can store approximately 20 million songs, 20,000 HD movies, or 2,000 standard iPhones worth of data.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations and Challenges</strong></p>

<p>While the technology is impressive, there are several limitations to consider:</p>

<ul>

<li>Manufacturing a disc takes about 6 minutes and uses a method similar to DVD production.</li>

<li>Current prototypes have writing speed and efficiency issues.</li>

<li>Energy consumption is estimated to be in the kilowatt range per terabyte of writing.</li>

<li>Write speed is only megabytes per second.</li>

<li>Cost is a significant factor, with a fosc laser costing nearly $50,000.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Future Prospects</strong></p>

<p>It may take years for this technology to become a commercially viable product, if ever. The technology may not be suitable for average consumers but could have significant applications in data centers. Research is ongoing, with potential for refinement and market response in the future.</p>

<p>As we look back at the journey of compact discs, from their inception to this new frontier of petabyte storage, it's clear that optical disc technology continues to evolve. While the days of unwrapping a new CD and hearing that crisp, clean sound may be behind us, the spirit of innovation that drove the original CD revolution lives on in these new 3D optical discs.</p>
