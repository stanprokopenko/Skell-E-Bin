<h2>Composition and Gesture</h2>

<p>When I draw for fun, I always start by setting up a <strong>frame</strong> and dividing it into <strong>halves and diagonals</strong>. This helps me guide the composition. I make sure not to align the figure's axis directly with these lines to avoid a displeasing look. I've learned to use the <strong>golden mean</strong> and focus on the <strong>active asymmetry</strong> between negative and positive space. The goal is to balance the composition so that one side has a dominant shape, and the other side has the opposite. A great practice is the <strong>"fly in the room" exercise</strong>, where you sketch nine compositions from different angles to get better at framing and perspective. When building the frame, I ensure there's dynamic interest by considering how the figure's parts, like legs and arms, interact with the frame. I pay close attention to the <strong>quality of shape</strong> I'm leaving, which ties back to my aesthetic and shape language.</p>

<h2>Anatomy and Shape Language</h2>

<p>For more detailed work or personal projects, I sometimes use a <strong>part-to-part gesture method</strong>, focusing on individual parts before the whole. This involves identifying the part, its gesture, and its perspective, aiming to create perspective with value for shading. I simplify the anatomy into shapes like <strong>Bs and Ss</strong> for legs, depending on their orientation. This approach is great for character artists who need to think about different body types. I connect limbs through the <strong>scapula</strong> and use shapes like <strong>Ss or triangles</strong> for arms, depending on their position. This method is more conscious of <strong>negative spaces</strong> and leans towards an observational style, focusing on designing shape and placement in relation to the frame. When adding secondary lines or contours, I build on the established shapes, adding subtle overlaps and ramps to suggest anatomy without detailed diagrams. I use my knowledge of anatomy to inform the drawing, focusing on creating a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing image.</p>

<h2>Rendering and Lighting</h2>

<p>Before moving on to lighting, I aim to solve as much as possible to avoid backtracking on form issues later. Lighting is crucial in defining the form and is directly related to the geometry of the subject. The light source is described as being slightly up and to the right but somewhat behind the observer. Differences in <strong>subcutaneous fat</strong> between genders affect the visibility of muscles like the triceps. I use geometric shapes to understand the form of muscles, likening the <strong>deltoid to a sphere</strong> and the <strong>triceps to a cylinder</strong>. The elbow is described as a box due to its sharp, projected bone. Understanding basic forms like ball, egg, and box is essential for accurately rendering light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Value and Shadow</h2>

<p>It's important to separate light from dark areas to establish the form and depth of the figure. I avoid outlining in value rendering, preferring to create edges through atmospheric effects to enhance realism. Rendering involves gradually building up values, starting with mid-tones and adding darker shades to develop the form and depth further. The concept of <strong>shape welding</strong> creates a cohesive pattern of shapes that both reveals important anatomical information and serves a compositional purpose. Reflected light and how it dissipates with distance from the source is a technique to enhance the realism of the rendering.</p>

<h2>Editing and Focal Points</h2>

<p>My strategy involves using a full range of values (1 through 10) at the top of the figure, reducing to three values at the midpoint, and further down to two values at the bottom. This helps de-emphasize the legs and manage viewer focus. Editing values, not the lack of seeing them, is crucial for artists to guide viewer attention effectively. I aim to mimic human peripheral vision rather than the uniform focus of a camera. Softening edges and reintroducing background values help integrate the figure into its surroundings. I continuously evaluate and adjust values and shapes, emphasizing the iterative nature of drawing and painting.</p>

<h2>Practical Exercises and Personal Insights</h2>

<p>I encourage trying the exercise of organizing a long pose within a frame, creating asymmetry, and building up light and shadow forms and values to develop drawing skills. I reflect on the foundational techniques covered in initial lessons and their application in more advanced figure rendering. Sharing personal anecdotes about learning and teaching art highlights the influence of mentors and the importance of studying with skilled artists to improve one's craft.</p>

<h2>Instructional Materials</h2>

<p>I've been asked about obtaining the instructional materials created during my time. These materials are for the associates I assist. There's a suggestion to combine these materials at Kinko's for physical copies, indicating a need for tangible resources.</p>
