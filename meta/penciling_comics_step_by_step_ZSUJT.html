<h2>Transferring Your Layout</h2>

<p>To begin transforming your reduced size layout into a full-size comic page, you'll need to trace it onto a new, larger sheet. This can be done using either a <strong>light box</strong> or a <strong>computer monitor</strong>. When doing this, your focus should be on the <strong>loose placement</strong> of elements rather than replicating every detail precisely.</p>

<h2>Establishing Panel Borders and Perspective</h2>

<p>Once your layout is transferred, the next step is to <strong>establish the panel borders</strong>. This involves drawing the outlines of each panel on your page. After the borders are in place, you'll need to <strong>lay in the proper perspective</strong> for each panel. This is particularly crucial for panels that depict larger scenes, as getting the perspective right is key to a believable space.</p>

<h2>Sketching and Tightening Elements</h2>

<p>With the panel borders and perspective established, you can start to <strong>re-establish your panels</strong>. This involves <strong>lightly sketching each element</strong> within the panels before tightening up these sketches. During this phase, it's important to use <strong>proper construction</strong> techniques for drawing faces, figures, and environmental elements. At this point, you should aim to create the <strong>cleanest, simplest version</strong> of your page, avoiding too much detail.</p>

<h2>Adding Details and Rendering</h2>

<p>After your page has been re-established with tight line drawings, you can begin to <strong>add line weight, shadows, and rendering</strong>. This step allows you to bring depth and dimension to your drawings. It's important to work <strong>systematically</strong> through the page, which will help you to identify and fix any issues that arise during this stage.</p>

<h2>Digital Work and Posting for Critique</h2>

<p>If you prefer working digitally, feel free to use your preferred digital tools and methods throughout this process. Once you've completed your full-size page, you should <strong>post images of both your final reduced size layout and your final pencils</strong>. By posting your assignments within the next month, you'll have a chance to be featured in a critique video. This is a great opportunity to receive feedback and improve your skills.</p>

<p><strong>Good luck</strong> with your assignment, and remember to approach each step methodically to achieve the best results!</p>
