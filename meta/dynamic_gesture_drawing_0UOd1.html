<p>I'm really into capturing the essence of a person's pose, especially when they're engrossed in an activity, like reading a book intensely, where their body language—tensed muscles, strained arms—tells a story. When drawing a seated pose with foreshortening, I start by observing the head and use wrapping lines to suggest the form and perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Gesture Drawing Approach</strong></p>

<p>My main goal with gesture drawing isn't to replicate the reference exactly. I focus more on exaggerating certain aspects, like diagonal lines or lengths, to highlight movement or dynamic qualities. I believe in starting with an exaggerated gesture and then refining it to be more accurate if needed. For poses that lean forward, I adjust my usual gesture drawing approach by switching the orientation of the lines I use to represent the body's gesture, creating a sense of forward lean. I use wrapping lines to further suggest the form and perspective of the pose, aiming for a consistent approach that can be adjusted as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Techniques for Foreshortening</strong></p>

<p>When checking proportions, I use the pelvis as a halfway point in the figure, which helps in maintaining correct proportions, especially in standing poses. This method also helps in avoiding overly long legs. For foreshortened figures, I shorten the lines representing parts of the body that are foreshortened and use ellipses to exaggerate the wrap of the form, adjusting the gesture to suggest the correct perspective. I emphasize certain lines to indicate movement or parts of the body that are closer to the viewer, using line weight to bring elements forward or make them more prominent.</p>

<p><strong>Maintaining Correct Proportions</strong></p>

<p>To ensure the gesture drawing is effective, I critically assess the lines to ensure they guide the viewer through the pose, creating a sense of movement and balance. For the legs, I adjust the length and direction of lines to suggest foreshortening, using curves to represent the form of the knees and lower legs. When drawing arms, especially in a pose where one arm is supporting the body's weight, I focus on creating a sense of weight and tension by adjusting the line weight and direction.</p>

<p><strong>Refining the Drawing</strong></p>

<p>The intense focus of the person on the book is conveyed through the body language and the detailed gesture drawing of the arm and hand positions. After establishing the gesture, I move on to identifying tilts and adding basic shapes to build upon the gesture drawing, preparing for further refinement.</p>
