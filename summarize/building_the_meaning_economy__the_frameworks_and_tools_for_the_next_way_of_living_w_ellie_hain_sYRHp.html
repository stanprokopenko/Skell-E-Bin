<h2>The Cultural Shift Towards Optimism and Meaning</h2>

<p>In recent years, especially since the pandemic, there has been an "opening" where more people are resonating with and understanding work on meaning and values. This shift is happening not just in places like San Francisco but globally, with younger generations, in response to dysfunctional systems and structures. </p>

<p>The opening can come in two ways - from genuine excitement about future possibilities, or from pain, burnout and exhaustion with the current dysfunctional systems. The pandemic was a global opening that made many realize how dysfunctional a lot of structures we live in are. Gen Z are having breakdowns entering the workforce because it's not how humans are built to live.</p>

<p>Polls show a big shift, with 70% now excited about the future vs only 10% a couple years ago. But there is still obliviousness, denial, anger and fear in response to the changes. Political willpower for change is growing, but many are still pessimistic. </p>

<p>This cultural shift manifests in various ways:</p>

<ul>

<li>The popularity of uplifting trance music in Berlin, in contrast to previously darker themes</li>

<li>The rise of movements like effective altruism and regenerative agriculture </li>

<li>Internet meme culture moving from dark twisted humor to more wholesome "healing" content, showing a generational exhaustion with irony and nihilism</li>

</ul>

<h2>Debates About AI's Impact on Human Nature and Society</h2>

<p>Some believe AI could allow us to radically reimagine how we live and understand ourselves as humans. Developments in biotech and education technology could also lead to drastic changes in society. </p>

<p>However, humans are still biological beings with the same fundamental needs for community, creativity, love and belonging. Much of life hasn't changed that much when viewed through this lens. There is a risk, especially for those immersed in technology, of having an imperialist perspective that overestimates how much AI will change everything. But for many people, life is not centered around technology.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Embodiment and Real-World Connection</h2>

<p>Modern society disconnects us from our bodies and instincts, starting from school where we are socialized to not do what we want, stay at our desks, and not speak or move too much. This is a constant assault on the body and instincts. It takes a lot of unlearning and experimentation to slowly get in touch with what we truly want. </p>

<p>The speaker and his wife are deliberately trying to break norms by downsizing their house, experimenting with living in a van, changing their diet and work engagement. It feels like rebelling against the systems and institutions.</p>

<p>Balancing immersion in technology with staying grounded in real-world communities and nature is key. Many people today feel alienated from their own bodies. There is no substitute for genuine curiosity and passion.</p>

<h2>Redesigning Systems Around Human Flourishing and Meaning</h2>

<p>The speaker's work provides a toolkit and framework for thinking about the inner drives, yearnings and desires that humans have, with the goal of designing systems like education, governance, and economics based around human nature. </p>

<p>What keeps people in hopelessness, numbness or denial is not seeing enough good options. After having revelations and new connections to oneself and life, people are often thrust back into dysfunctional systems without viable alternatives.</p>

<p>In education, the speaker believes in seeing each child's unique gift and working to nourish that. Not every child needs equal amounts of math, science or languages. Giving kids more independence and free time for self-directed learning might be more educational than current settings. </p>

<p>Doing work you love is not just about getting a job, it's about having the courage to go for it. You can't expect things to be handed to you. Doing passionate work like podcasts, research or serious art requires commitment and courage.</p>

<p>There can be dignity and meaning found even in service jobs. The speaker knows a supermarket cashier who is always smiling and kind, and everyone talks about him. You can find meaning in service or gardening jobs.</p>

<h2>The Moral Graph Research Project</h2>

<p>The moral graph research project surveyed Americans, asking them moral trolley problem questions and drilling down to the meaningful stories and values underlying their preferences.</p>

<p>Despite surveying Republicans and Democrats on controversial questions, the moral graph found that people agree much more about what's wise when you focus on their actual experiences rather than ideologies.</p>

<p>The moral graph maps the values people inputted and the relationships between values, identifying which values people consider wiser. A potential use case is embedding the insights into training schemes for future AI models to optimize for wisdom.</p>

<p>They are currently working on generating a larger, synthetic moral graph using GPT to create the stories and wise values, with the goal of fine-tuning a wiser AI model based on that graph.</p>

<h2>Using AI to Reimagine Possibilities, Not Just Incremental Improvements</h2>

<p>To make AI work well, people need to know what they want AI to help them with. Just putting AI into existing systems won't be transformative. </p>

<p>The point of AI should be creating an opening for new ways of living and thinking about the good life, not just doing more of the same. People need a new narrative.</p>

<p>The speaker's work aims to get people in touch with glimpses of the "spark of life" - special, meaningful moments - and convince them they could have much more of that good life.</p>

<p>They are working on immersive ritual events using AI to help people input their sources of meaning. The goal is a "collective constitution" based on what humanity finds beautiful and meaningful.</p>

<p>In the past, slow information required coming up with proxies and shorthands for values and meaning. Now we have the technology to actually explore and map the full range of human values.</p>

<h2>Finding Meaning Through Presence and Intuition</h2>

<p>The enemy is not suffering itself, but numbness - empty consumerism, alienating jobs that don't spark anything. Meaning can be found even in tough situations. </p>

<p>Meaningful activities are often difficult and involve some suffering (e.g. writing a book), but we find them worthwhile in retrospect. It's not about constant peak experiences.</p>

<p>Meaning exists on a spectrum of attention between numbness on one end, and a hyper-focused Buddha-like state detached from the world on the other. The goal is to align systems in the middle.</p>

<p>Some mantras to live by:

- "Make choices that you will regret the least." Consider which option you will regret less in the future when faced with a choice.

- Live life as if you're the main character in an interesting book. Make the most compelling choices.

- Listen to what you really want and then do that. This comes from experimentation and developing a fine-grained sense of likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>The speaker developed their own "moral graph" through deliberately breaking the mold, exploring, and exposing themselves to many ideas to discover what resonated with them, even without a clear plan. They trained their intuition this way.</p>

<p>Living in alignment with yourself is key, even as the self changes over time. Developing techniques to trust and fine-tune your intuition guides you to where you need to be. Those coming out of controlled environments may not have well-developed intuitions or enough life experience to honor them yet.</p>

<h2>The Role of Challenge and Struggle in Growth</h2>

<p>The proverb "Heaven helps those who help themselves" suggests that the harder you work in alignment, the more opportunities seem to magically appear. What you spend time thinking about and working towards is what you end up having in your life.</p>

<p>There is a process of following your intuition through hardship that can lead to more trust, joy and patience later on when you know you will get the things you want eventually. </p>

<p>Struggling and going through crucibles is an important part of life that tempers us, even if unpleasant and coming at a cost sometimes. Pressure forges diamonds.</p>

<p>The hero's journey myth of challenge, death and rebirth is deeply embedded in the collective consciousness and patterns of social reality.</p>
