<h2>National Security and AI</h2>

<p>Super intelligence is becoming crucial for national power. The National Security State is increasingly focusing on AI. This shift highlights the growing recognition of AI's potential impact on national security.</p>

<h2>Paul Nakasone's Appointment to OpenAI</h2>

<p>Paul Nakasone, who led the NSA from 2018 to 2023, has been appointed to OpenAI's Safety and Security committee. His new role aims to enhance AI's role in cybersecurity. OpenAI's announcement emphasizes that Nakasone will help make critical safety and security decisions. This move follows concerns about the safety culture at OpenAI.</p>

<h2>Concerns and Criticisms</h2>

<p>There are significant concerns and criticisms surrounding Nakasone's appointment:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Edward Snowden's Criticism</strong>: Snowden, living in Russia after leaking NSA data, sees Nakasone's appointment as problematic. He warns against trusting OpenAI or its products, calling the appointment a betrayal of rights.</li>

<li><strong>Community Notes</strong>: Notes highlight Nakasone's role in expanding NSA surveillance programs. The practice of big tech hiring former agency members to expand surveillance is also noted.</li>

</ul>

<h2>AI Self-Improvement and Future Projections</h2>

<p>Leopold's Ashid Brener's situational awareness paper discusses a potential explosion in intelligence by 2027 or 2028. Brener argues that AI progress will reach a point where automated AI research becomes possible. Nvidia's Eureka paper shows GPT-4 writing reward functions for training robots, outperforming humans in certain tasks. This suggests that AI self-improvement is becoming more feasible.</p>

<h2>Geopolitical Implications</h2>

<p>There are significant geopolitical implications of AI advancements:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Risks of Theft</strong>: Brener suggests that American AGI efforts may be futile as China could steal algorithmic breakthroughs and model weights. Model weights, like those for Elon Musk's AI company xAI's Grok, are easily transferable.</li>

<li><strong>Proliferation to Rogue States</strong>: Superintelligence could proliferate to rogue states if model weights are easily copied.</li>

<li><strong>Protection Needs</strong>: OpenAI's announcement of Nakasone's appointment aligns with concerns about protecting systems from sophisticated bad actors.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Global AI Development and Sovereignty</h2>

<p>The concept of "sovereign AI" suggests that each nation or culturally affiliated group of nations should develop its own AI. This is driven by efforts to avoid dependence on U.S. and China:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Technological Independence</strong>: AI companies in India, South Korea, France, and other countries believe they can't afford to rely on the U.S. or China for AI technology.</li>

<li><strong>Key Players</strong>: Nvidia is highlighted as a key player in AI development. The UK has DeepMind, acquired by Google, and other European regulators are becoming more aggressive.</li>

</ul>

<h2>OpenAI's Policy Changes and Military Applications</h2>

<p>OpenAI might change to a for-profit benefit corporation, which could lead to an IPO. In January, OpenAI's policy change allowed military applications, raising questions about its use in national security. Microsoft has deployed GPT-4 for Pentagon use in a top-secret cloud, enhancing the Department of Defense's data handling capabilities. This integration of AI in national security raises questions about its implications for AI, OpenAI, and global users.</p>

<h2>Audience Engagement and Perspectives</h2>

<p>The audience is encouraged to share their viewpoints and alignments with figures like Leopold Ashenbrener or Edward Snowden. Ashenbrener discusses AGI realism and the acceleration of technology, referencing concepts like Dyson spheres and the Kardashev scale. The "doomers" have been ahead in recognizing AI's potential threats but are criticized for being untethered from empirical realities. The appointment of Nakasone highlights the intersection of AI and national security, and the blurring of lines between government agencies and top AI labs is seen as a natural progression. Edward Snowden warns about the intersection of AI with mass surveillance data, giving unaccountable power to a few. The audience is asked to share their stance on AI development and its implications for global security and power dynamics. A survey is mentioned to gauge audience opinions on these issues.</p>
