<p>I've been in sales for over 30 years, selling to every Fortune 500 company at least once. Most of my sales have been in the tens of millions. I have a 10-step plan to make any sale happen. This process will help you learn to sell, and everyone is a salesperson in some way. People will judge you and your product as a personal brand without you realizing it. If you can't listen for 5 minutes to this knowledge, you might not make it in sales.</p>

<h2>The 10-Step Sales Plan</h2>

<p>I have a 10-step plan that covers how to think like a salesperson, close sales, and manage ongoing and repeat sales. Patience, perseverance, and focus are crucial in learning sales. Some people prefer to call sales "marketing," but it's all about getting people on your side.</p>

<h2>Essential Sales Principles</h2>

<p><strong>Ethical sales</strong> are important; avoid tricks like the 99p rule, which aims to deceive customers. Authenticity is key in sales; be honest and genuine. Authenticity leads to long-term relationships and repeat sales. An example of authenticity: a salesperson at a Mini garage recommended a Tesla, which built trust. Over-deliver on what you sell; make sure you believe in the product. Don't promise more than you can guarantee; be clear about what you can deliver.</p>

<h2>Building Relationships in Sales</h2>

<p><strong>Identify who could buy your product and if they need it.</strong> Understand the person you're selling to and build a relationship. Present your product and its benefits. Most people start with the last step first, which is a mistake. Example: Instead of selling a pen by describing it, first ask if the person needs a pen. Be persistent and stay in contact with potential clients. Ensure there is a market fit for your product. Build a relationship with the client; mutual liking is crucial. If the first two steps are right, the third step (selling the product) will be easy. Clients may even help you with pricing if they like and need your service.</p>

<h2>Authenticity and Ethical Sales</h2>

<p>Authenticity, not overselling, and over-delivering are foundational principles. The best salespeople often don't realize they're selling; they're just sharing knowledge and being proud of their product. Lean into your natural style, whether you're an introvert or extrovert. Train everyone involved in your life to sell your product, even if it sounds unusual. Train everyone, including dads, to be your salesperson. Know the rules of selling; they are teachable.</p>

<h2>Leveraging Tools and Techniques</h2>

<p>Sales is a system; use tools like Pipedrive to track and manage the sales process. Always connect with clients through various means (e.g., newsletters, birthday notes). Leverage is important in sales; use existing clients or brand names to build credibility. Sometimes you may need to do free work initially to gain leverage. Reputation matters; always do a good job for clients.</p>

<h2>Emotional Sales and Storytelling</h2>

<p>Don't sell a product; sell the outcome or feeling it provides. Example: Sell the feeling of eating ice cream, not the ingredients. Apple sells a feeling, not the technical specs. Focus on the outcome your product brings, not the features. Only sell what you believe in; it's easier and more genuine. Selling something you believe in makes the world a better place or improves someone's life. Many people don't realize that anyone can sell something they believe in. It's important to work with companies you believe in and ask for equity. Sell something that brings value and makes a difference in people's lives.</p>

<h2>Creativity and Out-of-the-Box Thinking</h2>

<p>One effective sales method is having others sell for you. Brand partnerships and leveraging other brands can be powerful in sales. Example: McDonald's sponsors the Olympics to leverage the brand's aspirational qualities. Aligning with other brands can amplify your message and reach. Example: Potential partnership with Liquid Death, a water brand, to leverage each other's messages. Brand partnerships don't always require money; they can be resource-based. Concept of "1 + 1 = 11" in sales: partnerships can exponentially increase impact. Emotional sales are powerful and involve connecting on a personal level. Example: Launching a book on Amazon and reaching number one without reviews by focusing on the mission rather than the product. Emotional sales require authenticity and genuine belief in the mission. Example: Elon Musk's emotional sales approach with Tesla, focusing on saving the planet. Emotional sales must be true and authentic to avoid damaging your brand. Example: Don Draper's emotional pitch for the Kodak Carousel, showing personal and authentic moments. Sales is about being authentic, having a team, community, and purpose. Out-of-the-box thinking can help in sales and marketing. Example: Suggesting people buy two dishwashers to avoid putting dishes away. Wild ideas and creativity can make sales and marketing more effective. Example: Building a glass-encased staircase in Twickenham for community engagement. Embrace madness and creativity in sales to stand out.</p>
