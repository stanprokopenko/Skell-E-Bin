<p>People often focus on deadlines rather than going above and beyond in their work environments. Making environments part of your process and visual identity can elevate your work.</p>

<h2>Background of Daniel Warren Johnson</h2>

<p>My name is Daniel Warren Johnson, and I've worked on various Marvel comics, including covers for Cable and the miniseries <strong>Beta Ray Bill Argent Star</strong>. Marvel allowed me to choose my project, and I chose Beta Ray Bill, which I find to be the coolest character I've worked on. Beta Ray Bill combines fantasy and sci-fi visuals, a blend achieved well by Walt Simonson. Scuttlebutt, Beta Ray Bill's ship, is fun to draw due to its unique design by Walt Simonson.</p>

<p>I've been working in comics since 2012 and started getting paid in late 2013. My first Marvel comic was a one-shot with Matthew Rosenberg about the character Quake from the Avengers. Reading comics growing up led me to pursue this medium, though I initially leaned towards digital and conceptual art. Breaking into comics required me to create my own projects and teach myself the necessary skills.</p>

<h2>Inspirations and Influences</h2>

<p>The <strong>Punisher Max series by Garth Ennis</strong> and the <strong>Ed McGuinness and Joe Kelly run on Deadpool</strong> are major inspirations for me.</p>

<h2>Importance of Environments in Comics</h2>

<p>Environments in comics are more than just backgrounds; they are fully fleshed-out spaces where characters can interact. Environments add depth and realism to scenes, making them more engaging and fun to draw. Your own living space can inspire the environments you create for characters, adding storytelling depth. Sometimes environments need to take center stage in a story, requiring detailed and intentional design.</p>

<h2>Designing Environments</h2>

<p>Writers may not always provide detailed descriptions of environments, so it's important to go above and beyond the script. When writing my own scripts, I keep descriptions sparse and rely on visual elements.</p>

<h2>Mastering Perspective</h2>

<p>Mastering perspective is crucial for making environments fun rather than a chore. Using a grid can help with perspective, but a ruler is not always necessary. Digital tools can make perspective too perfect, so it's important to maintain a balance. I often freehand my perspective grids and focus on the composition and vibe during the thumbnail stage. Different perspective grids can be used depending on what best serves the story and composition.</p>

<h2>Practice and Improvement</h2>

<p>Practicing perspective and other skills regularly is essential for improvement. It's important to focus on different aspects of drawing, like environments or anatomy, for short periods to avoid burnout. Not every panel needs a detailed background; focus on making one panel stand out.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Creativity</h2>

<p>Taking breaks and resting is crucial to avoid burnout and maintain creativity. Drawing comics is about storytelling, not perfection, and it's important to keep practicing and creating. The only way to get better at making comics is to actively make comics, not just practice on the side.</p>
