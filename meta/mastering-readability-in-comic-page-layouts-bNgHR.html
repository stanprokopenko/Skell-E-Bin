<h2>Overview of Student Submissions</h2>

<p>Overall, the students created <strong>fun and dynamic pages</strong>. The <strong>Portal page submissions</strong> were particularly impressive.</p>

<h2>Common Issues</h2>

<p>A common issue was the <strong>misinterpretation of the "close up" direction</strong> in the script. This led to overly close shots that obscured character identities. It's crucial to have <strong>clear character identification</strong> in panels, especially for key characters like Thor, Tony, and Bruce Banner.</p>

<p>Some submissions were <strong>too sketchy</strong>, making it hard to discern characters and actions. It's important to have <strong>clear, readable layouts</strong> for editors and writers.</p>

<h2>Balancing Speed and Clarity</h2>

<p>The ideal goal is to <strong>lay out a 22-page comic in about five hours</strong>. Balancing speed and clarity in initial layouts is essential. Avoid overly detailed initial layouts to prevent attachment to early drawings.</p>

<p>Some students submitted all 22 pages on one page, making it hard to read. Always think about how others will perceive the work.</p>

<h2>Specific Feedback</h2>

<h3>Aaron Smith</h3>

<p>Great layouts but needed to <strong>pull back on close-ups</strong> to ensure character recognition.</p>

<p>Dynamic layouts but <strong>too detailed</strong>, affecting readability.</p>

<p>Hard to read due to <strong>lack of character clarity</strong>.</p>

<h3>Monkey X Monkey</h3>

<p>Almost perfect layouts, balanced between loose and detailed, very readable.</p>

<h3>Alec Gonzalez</h3>

<p>Dynamic but <strong>too much open space</strong> between panels, affecting the use of page real estate. Use white space effectively to tell the story without wasting drawing space.</p>

<p><strong>Too loose and small</strong>, making it unreadable.</p>

<p>Interesting layouts but needed to consider <strong>dialogue placement and panel perspectives</strong>. Highlighted Pamela's creative use of Loki sitting outside the panels, adding interest to dialogue-heavy pages.</p>
