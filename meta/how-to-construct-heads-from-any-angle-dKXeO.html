<p>We finished talking about our basic layout of proportions. The goal now is to review, make sure we have those initial steps solid, and then develop the next. We began looking at a front view as a nice example of our skull. The same build-up applies: sphere, center line, and tilt. It's always nice when you can match those, but don't always count on it. Look for the diagonals and the leans.</p>

<h2>Front View Proportions</h2>

<p>Start with the sphere and center line. Develop the chin and overall face shape. There's often a slight lean to the neck, but exaggeration early on is better. We'll add more information on top, which naturally stifles exaggeration a bit.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Brow Line</strong>: Think about the cross.</li>

<li><strong>Proportions</strong>: Half face of the nose, half bottom of the sockets, path, eye, and keystone.</li>

</ul>

<p>Every line should describe a surface consistent with the brow. Avoid straight or aggressive lines to maintain the early curvature of the head. These guidelines help build the later scaffolding of the skull and head construction.</p>

<h2>Three-Quarter View Proportions</h2>

<p>Set up the head with a tilt and center line. Relate the chin back to the large sphere of the head and neck. Use offset axes in space or tilt for the ellipse of the neck.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Proportional Markers</strong>:<ul>

<li>Brow Line</li>

<li>Halfway is the nose</li>

<li>Halfway is the socket</li>

<li>Halfway is the keystone and eye</li>

<li>Thirds for the mouth</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>These markers guide the orientation of your lines. Always draw what you see, but remember you're making a drawing, not the thing you see. Connect what you see with how you interpret it.</p>

<h2>Extreme Foreshortening</h2>

<p>When someone is looking up or down, the clean division of proportions doesn't work. However, the initial setup of proportion markers remains the same. The projection of features off the face changes instead.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: The cartilage of the tip of the nose is closer to the eye.</li>

<li><strong>Halves</strong>: The halves still work, even in extreme foreshortening.</li>

</ul>

<p>Maintain the same arc and wrapping surface. This consistency helps in extremely foreshortened views.</p>

<h2>Profile View Proportions</h2>

<p>Rhythm and asymmetry are crucial. The balance of bone and muscle moves naturally.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Proportional Markers</strong>:<ul>

<li>Brow Line</li>

<li>Nose</li>

<li>Cheekbone</li>

<li>Chin</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Youthful faces conceal the skull, while aging reveals it. The cheekbone structure is key to understanding age. The skin and fat on the face change with age, exposing or concealing the skull.</p>

<h2>Back View Proportions</h2>

<p>Applying proportions to back views can be challenging. Use landmarks like the brow and ear for perspective.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Drawing Through</strong>: Develop form by drawing through the head.</li>

<li><strong>Landmarks</strong>: Use the brow and ear to indicate perspective.</li>

</ul>

<p>Even in back views, the same proportion markers can be useful. Draw through and build form, considering the landscape of the head.</p>

<h2>Anatomical Considerations</h2>

<p>The cheekbone plays a significant role in aging. The structural fat of the face changes, exposing areas of bone and creating an aged look. Youthful faces have more concealed bone structure.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Skull Structure</strong>: Different species have different skull structures. For example, a lion's cheekbone comes out like a suitcase handle, fitting more muscle.</li>

<li><strong>Diet and Evolution</strong>: Our diet and evolutionary habits have impacted our facial structure. Early humans had a larger nasal aperture due to a different diet, while modern humans have a smaller nasal aperture due to processed foods.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Practical Tips and Observations</h2>

<p>Routine and repetition are essential in drawing. Follow a consistent order to make it easier to remember.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Routine</strong>: Nose, then work up, half, half, half, then mouth and chin.</li>

<li><strong>2D to 3D</strong>: Translate 2D balance into 3D perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Personal Approach</strong>: Develop your own drawing approaches and abstractions.</li>

</ul>

<p>By following these steps and understanding the underlying principles, you can master head proportions from different angles and create more accurate and dynamic drawings.</p>
