<h2>Feeling Limited by Technical Drawing Skills</h2>

<p>I'm currently working in my daily sketchbook, drawing from observation and imagination. While I can capture simple poses and scenes, I want to push my drawings further to convey more <strong>motion, energy, and action</strong>. However, I often feel constrained by my logical thinking and the need to accurately depict reality based on my observations. It's challenging to break free from these technical habits to capture the level of expression I envision.</p>

<h3>Breaking Down Elements to Manipulate</h3>

<p>To push my poses further, I'm analyzing the different elements I can manipulate:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Camera distance and angle:</strong> Getting closer to the subject, using foreshortening and perspective to create depth</li>

<li><strong>Scale:</strong> Exaggerating the size relationships between elements</li>

<li><strong>Twisting and exaggerating the pose:</strong> Pushing the torso, limbs, and overall pose beyond realistic proportions</li>

<li><strong>Looking to animation for inspiration:</strong> Studying how animators use abstracted, dynamic poses to convey motion and energy in a series of frames</li>

</ul>

<p>By intentionally playing with these elements, I hope to break away from the constraints of realistic representation and capture more expressive poses.</p>

<h2>Letting Go to Draw Intuitively</h2>

<p>To tap into a more intuitive drawing approach, I start by loosely placing basic landmarks for the figure, such as the head, shoulders, and limbs. From there, I consciously let go of construction and allow myself to draw without overthinking. The key is to keep moving the pen, even if the resulting sketch has imperfections or areas I don't like. </p>

<p>When I feel myself starting to force the drawing or get caught up in fixing details, I stop and reflect on what's working and what isn't. This helps me identify the successful aspects of the sketch that I want to carry forward.</p>

<h3>Balancing the Logical and Intuitive</h3>

<p>While pushing towards more expressive drawing, I still recognize the value of my technical skills. It's about finding a balance between the logical and intuitive approaches. I use the landmarks of anatomy to establish the basic pose, but then allow for more gestural, dynamic linework. </p>

<p>When it comes to light and shadow, I focus on designing them aesthetically to support the overall feeling and composition, rather than strictly adhering to realistic lighting. </p>

<h2>Practicing and Exploring Through Sketches</h2>

<p>To develop this new approach, putting in the mileage and repetition is crucial. I dedicate time to sketching, where I allow myself to play, make mistakes, and embrace imperfection. It's all about exploring and seeing what happens, without putting pressure on any one drawing.</p>

<p>Trying different angles of the same pose is a valuable exercise. It challenges me to interpret the pose from multiple viewpoints, rather than relying on a single, memorized image. </p>

<p>Another important lesson is knowing when to stop and move on to a new sketch. Overworking a drawing can lead to losing the energy and getting caught up in unnecessary details. It's better to do multiple quick studies, learning something from each one.</p>

<h3>Having Clear Intent for Finished Illustrations</h3>

<p>When it comes to creating finished illustrations, having references and a clear intent is essential. I need to know what level of realism or stylization I'm aiming for, and have a vision for the end result. This helps me make intentional decisions and know when the piece is done, avoiding overworking.</p>

<p>However, in my sketches and studies, I give myself the freedom to be more exploratory and focus on the process of learning and discovery. Not every sketch needs to be a perfectly polished piece. </p>

<p>By balancing technical skills with intuitive expression, and dedicating time to deliberate practice and exploration, I aim to push my work to new levels of dynamism and visual impact. It's an ongoing journey of growth and evolving as an artist.</p>
