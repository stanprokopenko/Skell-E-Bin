<p>I've noticed a growing issue with social media acting like a parasite on our free will, especially for artists, and it's been happening for at least 24 years. Social media, while beneficial in some ways, has largely prioritized engagement over artistic merit, leading to a devaluation of hard work. From childhood, many of us are told art is a waste of time, yet art is everywhere in our lives, often taken for granted. My own mental health journey has shown me that the relationship between artists and social media mirrors that of a narcissistic or codependent relationship, with cycles of love bombing and discard. For example, starting a new account on Instagram and initially receiving a lot of engagement can feel rewarding, but soon, the algorithm demands more for less reward, trapping artists in a cycle of chasing engagement. Platforms like Twitch introduce ad functionalities that compromise viewer experience for minimal financial gain, highlighting the exploitation of creators. This situation raises questions about free will and whether artists have surrendered their autonomy to algorithmic demands. Despite some improvements, like YouTube's algorithm showing new creators, the underlying issue remains: social media encourages fitting in over self-discovery, leading to self-doubt and loss of identity. My personal experience reflects these challenges, with years spent trying to conform to what seemed popular or successful on various platforms, leading to a loss of personal identity and connection with my audience. The pandemic initially boosted engagement as people turned to online content, but the return to normalcy revealed the fragile nature of this success. Through these struggles, I've learned valuable lessons about art and developed a stronger sense of self, which I've channeled into my work and teaching. The core issue is the perversion of art, where its intrinsic value is traded for something common like money, exacerbated by distractions like AI art fears. We've collectively contributed to this problem by relinquishing our sovereignty to platforms that dictate success, but we also hold the power to redefine success for ourselves. Prince's insights from decades ago resonate today, emphasizing that success is a personal feeling, not determined by external validation. The shift away from social media's influence will be challenging, but it's necessary for reclaiming our creativity and identity. Feedback from my community highlights widespread feelings of devaluation and the misconception that social media is the only path to success as an artist. Social media's promise of connectivity has ironically led to disconnection, underscoring the need for a new approach to creativity and success. DeviantArt was a pioneering platform in the early internet era, allowing anyone to post images online since the year 2000, marking a significant moment in the democratization of art sharing. The role of artists extends beyond creating art; it involves commenting on life and society, a tradition that didn't end with political cartoons but continues in various forms today. Traditional media like newspapers and TV networks laid the groundwork for social media, which initially promised freedom of speech but has become heavily regulated, affecting what content creators can share without fear of demonetization or cancellation. The music industry, with its lyrics often embedding truths, serves as an inspiration for visual artists to subtly communicate messages. The pressure for continuous growth in capitalism undermines the authenticity and meaning in creative work, pushing brands and individuals to prioritize trends over originality. This relentless pursuit of growth fosters a toxic environment that harms individual identity and self-worth, disconnecting artists from their intuition, the source of creativity. Balancing logic with emotion is crucial; leaning too heavily on one side can lead to destruction. This concept is ancient and even referenced in religious texts like the Bible. Trying to conform at the expense of one's true self can lead to shame, depression, isolation, and despair, creating a cycle that's hard to break without a significant shift in perspective. Many people feel they are "good at nothing" because they've internalized societal messages that devalue their unique talents and interests. Authenticity in creation is key to connecting with others who appreciate and support your work, even if it feels daunting to share your true self. The concept of polarity—opposing forces creating movement and meaning—is fundamental to the universe and can be applied to creativity to avoid stagnation. Examples from various fields illustrate how stagnation is detrimental, emphasizing the importance of movement and change for health and vitality. Embracing one's unique perspective and creativity, despite societal pressures to conform, is essential for personal fulfillment and making a meaningful impact. The journey towards authentic self-expression is challenging, requiring daily reminders to persist through doubt and fear, but it's crucial for personal and artistic growth. Every individual has inherent value and a unique purpose that cannot be defined by others or discovered through conformity. The importance of embracing one's unique identity and creativity is emphasized as a way to honor the sacrifices of ancestors and fulfill one's potential. Even small acts of creativity, like a doodle made on a bus ride, hold value in the grand scheme of the universe, underscoring the importance of staying positive and balanced in one's creative endeavors.</p>

<h2>Social Media's Impact on Artists</h2>

<p>Social media has significantly impacted artists, often prioritizing <strong>engagement over artistic merit</strong>. This shift leads to a devaluation of hard work and creativity, as artists find themselves trapped in a cycle of chasing engagement to stay relevant. The relationship between artists and social media can be likened to <strong>narcissistic or codependent dynamics</strong>, where initial rewards and recognition are quickly replaced by the demand for more content, with diminishing returns. This cycle can be particularly evident on platforms like Instagram, where starting a new account may initially bring a lot of engagement, but soon, the algorithm changes, demanding more content for less reward.</p>

<p>Moreover, platforms like <strong>Twitch</strong> have introduced functionalities that compromise the viewer experience for minimal financial gain to the creator, highlighting the <strong>exploitation of creators</strong>. These platforms often dictate the terms of success, pushing artists to conform to algorithmic demands rather than focusing on their creativity and self-discovery. This situation raises concerns about artists' autonomy and the true value of art in the age of social media.</p>

<h2>The Devaluation of Art</h2>

<p>Art is everywhere in our lives, yet it's often <strong>taken for granted</strong>. Despite its ubiquity, from childhood, many of us are told that art is a waste of time. This contradiction highlights a significant issue in how art is perceived and valued in society. </p>

<p>Social media has exacerbated this problem by encouraging artists to <strong>fit in rather than discover themselves</strong>. This push towards conformity leads to self-doubt and a loss of identity among artists. The platforms prioritize engagement over artistic merit, leading to a cycle where artists chase likes and shares at the expense of their creativity and personal growth. This environment fosters a culture where art is devalued, and the unique voices of artists are drowned out by the noise of what's popular or trending.</p>

<h2>Personal Journey and Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Throughout my journey, I've faced <strong>personal struggles with social media</strong> and experienced a significant <strong>loss of identity</strong>. Trying to conform to what seemed popular or successful on various platforms led me to lose my personal identity and connection with my audience. The pandemic initially provided a temporary boost to engagement as people turned to online content, but the return to normalcy revealed the fragile nature of this success.</p>

<p>From these experiences, I've learned valuable lessons about art and myself. I've developed a <strong>stronger sense of self</strong>, which I've channeled into my work and teaching. These struggles have taught me the importance of authenticity and the dangers of surrendering our creativity and identity to the demands of social media algorithms. Embracing my unique perspective and creativity, despite societal pressures to conform, has been essential for my personal fulfillment and making a meaningful impact.</p>

<h2>The Perversion of Art</h2>

<p>The core issue we're facing is the <strong>perversion of art</strong>, where its intrinsic value is traded for something as common as money. This problem is exacerbated by distractions, such as fears surrounding AI art, which divert our attention from the deeper issues at hand. </p>

<p>Art, in its purest form, is about expression, communication, and connection. However, when the focus shifts from these fundamental values to monetary gain, the essence of art is compromised. This shift not only affects the quality and authenticity of the art produced but also impacts the artists themselves, leading to a loss of identity and purpose.</p>

<p>The distractions from AI art fears serve as a smokescreen, preventing us from addressing the real issue: our collective contribution to the problem by relinquishing our sovereignty to platforms that dictate what success looks like. It's crucial to recognize that while these platforms may offer opportunities for exposure and engagement, they should not define our worth as artists or the value of our work.</p>

<h2>Redefining Success</h2>

<p>We've collectively contributed to a problem by <strong>surrendering our sovereignty to platforms</strong> that dictate what success looks like. This has led to a situation where success is often measured by external validation rather than personal fulfillment. However, it's crucial to understand that <strong>success is a personal feeling</strong>, not determined by likes, shares, or follower counts. </p>

<p>The necessity of shifting away from social media's influence is evident. While these platforms can offer exposure, they should not dictate our worth as artists or the value of our work. The shift away from social media's influence will be challenging, but it's necessary for reclaiming our creativity and identity. </p>

<p>Prince's insights from decades ago resonate today, emphasizing that success is about personal fulfillment, not external validation. This perspective is essential for artists who wish to maintain their autonomy and integrity in an age where social media platforms have a significant influence on what is considered successful.</p>

<h2>The Role of Artists in Society</h2>

<p>Artists play a crucial role in <strong>commenting on life and society</strong>. This tradition of artists as commentators and critics of societal norms and issues didn't end with political cartoons but continues in various forms today. Through their work, artists have the power to reflect on societal values, challenge perceptions, and inspire change.</p>

<p>The continuation of this tradition is evident in how artists use various mediums to communicate messages and provoke thought. From traditional media like newspapers and TV networks to modern platforms like social media, artists have adapted to the changing landscape to ensure their voices are heard. Despite the challenges posed by heavily regulated platforms, which can affect what content creators can share without fear of demonetization or cancellation, artists continue to find ways to subtly embed truths and messages in their work.</p>

<p>The music industry serves as an inspiration for visual artists in this regard, with lyrics often embedding truths that resonate with listeners. This approach to embedding messages in art encourages artists to continue using their creativity to comment on and influence society positively.</p>

<h2>The Influence of Capitalism on Creativity</h2>

<p>The pressure for <strong>continuous growth</strong> in capitalism significantly undermines the authenticity and meaning in creative work. This relentless pursuit pushes both brands and individuals to prioritize trends over originality, creating a toxic environment that harms individual identity and self-worth. </p>

<p>In such an environment, artists are disconnected from their intuition, which is the source of creativity. This disconnection fosters a culture where art is produced not for its intrinsic value or the joy of creation but for monetary gain and social validation. </p>

<p><strong>Balancing logic with emotion</strong> is crucial in this context. Leaning too heavily on one side can lead to destruction, a concept that is ancient and even referenced in religious texts like the Bible. </p>

<p>Trying to conform at the expense of one's true self can lead to feelings of shame, depression, isolation, and despair. This creates a cycle that's hard to break without a significant shift in perspective. Many people feel they are "good at nothing" because they've internalized societal messages that devalue their unique talents and interests. </p>
