<p>Welcome to this lesson in the hand sculpting course. In this lesson, we're going to cover the bones of the hand and sculpt the hand as our assignment. Understanding the bones of the hand is essential for sculpting the hand in clay or representing it in any medium. The bones make up about 90% of the mass of the hand, so understanding them is crucial for understanding the hand as a whole. This might be one of the most important studies for the course.</p>

<h2>Proportions of the Hand</h2>

<p>The hand itself is about the size of the face. We can separate the hand into three groups: the wrist, the palm, and the fingers, or in bone terms, the carpals, the metacarpals, and the phalanges. Achieving accurate proportions is essential, and the halves method can help with this.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Halves Method</strong>: <ul>

<li>Take the distance from the beginning of the wrist to the tip of the middle finger.</li>

<li>Cut that in half to find where the metacarpals end (the first large knuckle).</li>

<li>Cut that in half again to find the next knuckle.</li>

<li>Cut that in half again to find the final knuckle.</li>

<li>Half of the tip of the finger is where the fingernail begins.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>The knuckles aren't aligned horizontally; they follow curved rhythms through the hand, making it more interesting. Include these rhythms in your anatomy study. The webbing between the fingers happens about halfway up the first phalange and is tilted forward.</p>

<h2>The Wrist (Carpals)</h2>

<p>There are eight bones in the wrist, all with complex shapes and forms. Even when the wrist is posed at extreme angles, it's hard to make out any of these bony forms on the surface. Simplify these into basic forms when sculpting.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Simplification</strong>: Think about the shapes between these bony features and get a rough idea of the shape that the carpals make in the wrist.</li>

<li><strong>Movement</strong>: The wrist allows rotation forward and back and a little side to side. It has more flexibility moving back and forth than side to side.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Palm (Metacarpals)</h2>

<p>The metacarpals make up a roughly square shape for the palm of the hand. Notice the curvature of them.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Curvature</strong>: The wrist has an inside curve, which also exists in the bones. It's curved in a bowl shape on the inside (concave) and convex on the back of the hand.</li>

<li><strong>Shape Influence</strong>: The bones inform the shape of the entire hand.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Fingers (Phalanges)</h2>

<p>The thumb has a special saddle joint that makes it extra flexible and able to rotate in many directions. The metacarpals and phalanges have a similar structure.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hinge Joints</strong>: Allow for flexion, enabling the fist-grabbing motion and holding things.</li>

<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: The first joint of the fingers has some side-to-side flexibility, but the next joints only move forward and back.</li>

<li><strong>Condyles</strong>: These are the two bumps on the back of the knuckle that continue all the way around. They are tilted out, making the back of the knuckle narrower and the front wider.</li>

<li><strong>Curvature</strong>: The phalanges have a slight curvature that bends towards the middle finger.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Sculpting Tips</h2>

<p>For this assignment, do a life-size hand study sculpture of the bones of the hand. Use the provided 3D models or the Skelly app.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Pay attention to the shape of the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpals. Notice how the bones of the forearm connect to the carpals, how the carpals connect to the metacarpals, and how the metacarpals connect to the phalanges.</li>

<li><strong>Silhouettes</strong>: If any bone is giving you a hard time, focus on its silhouette or outline. Turn it to the side, get the silhouette from that angle with a wall of clay, then turn it 90 degrees and get the silhouette from that angle. Connect those two silhouettes by thinking about whether they're connected in a rounded or blocky way. Look for flat and rounded areas.</li>

</ul>

<p>Stay creative and productive. In the next lesson, we'll add some muscles onto these bones to gain a better understanding of the anatomy. See you around!</p>
