<p>I was grinding at YouTube for 3 and 1/2 years before I made a dollar. Success, to me, is being able to continue doing what you love. In this episode, I talk to Sam Lewis, an art YouTuber with about 10 years of experience. Sam started solo without any experience and eventually moved to a bigger studio in Brooklyn. He hosts figure drawing classes, a podcast, and has space for larger paintings.</p>

<h2>Sam Lewis's Journey</h2>

<p>Sam began his journey without any prior experience. Over time, he transitioned from working solo to moving into a larger studio in Brooklyn. This new space allowed him to host figure drawing classes, run a podcast, and create larger paintings. His journey highlights the importance of starting small and gradually expanding.</p>

<h2>Starting Without Waiting</h2>

<p>Many people struggle with finishing projects and getting things done. Sam built a substantial YouTube following by experimenting and doing crazy art projects. One key to success is executing and making things consistently. Whether the video or painting was good or bad, the important part was doing it. Many people feel they need to prepare extensively before starting, which holds them back. The best approach is to put things out, learn from them, and improve iteratively.</p>

<h2>Balancing Creative Fulfillment and Financial Sustainability</h2>

<p>Success brings different anxieties, like maintaining a studio and getting more views. Sam's YouTube channel has had ups and downs, with views fluctuating. Investing significant time in a project that doesn't perform well can be disheartening. The goal is to balance creative fulfillment with financial sustainability. Overcoming fear and being okay with failure is crucial. Passion and intention are essential for long-term success. Starting with the intention to make money can lead to disappointment. The best approach is to do what you love and be smart about finding opportunities.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Fear and Embracing Failure</h2>

<p>The fear of putting work out never fully goes away, even after achieving some success. Sam was nervous about sharing his early videos and didn't post them on his personal Instagram. Experience with failure helps in not taking poor performance personally. Falling in love with the process and prioritizing personal enjoyment over business concerns is crucial for sustainability. Improvement in any field is incremental and requires consistent effort and experimentation.</p>

<h2>The Process of Improvement</h2>

<p>Enjoying the process is essential for long-term commitment. Financial incentives can motivate, but genuine interest is necessary for sustained effort. Many people give up too quickly due to unrealistic expectations of fast success. Adapting to the medium and balancing art with commerce is necessary but can be existentially challenging. Art and business mindsets are different; switching between them requires practice. Multitasking between creative and business tasks can be fun but is not for everyone.</p>

<h2>Consistent Effort and Execution</h2>

<p>Listening to successful people often reveals the same advice: consistent effort and improvement are key. Many people overthink and over-plan instead of starting and executing their ideas. Less than 1% of people actually start and consistently execute their ideas. Financial risk and lack of disposable income can hinder starting new ventures. A realistic approach is to maintain a full-time job while hustling on the side until the new venture picks up. Transitioning to full-time creative work often takes years of effort and gradual progress. There is no overnight success; it's a snowball effect over years.</p>

<h2>The Reality of Creative Careers</h2>

<p>Even after initial success, the journey involves continuous ups and downs and strategic planning. Freelance jobs can help pay the bills while pursuing creative goals. The appeal of traditional jobs lies in the clear separation between work and rest, unlike the constant engagement required in creative fields. I constantly worry about my endless to-do list, thinking about it from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep. There's no off time; my mind is always running, even if I'm not in my studio.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Personal Enjoyment</h2>

<p>Coping with emotions and pushing past resistance or struggle is what leads people to become admired figures. Success is about continuing to do the work, like editing, filming, and taking creative risks. It's always about the next project; you never truly arrive at success. I don't consider myself successful, but I'm able to keep going, which is the true success. The core goal is to keep the work alive and maintain my freedom.</p>

<h2>Improvement and Feedback</h2>

<p>Starting an art journey requires a lot of faith and optimism, especially when comparing oneself to those with decades of experience. The process is nuanced and specific to individual paths, but it's not all doom and gloom. There are many ways to make money and pursue creative endeavors; you just have to try different things. Most people watching are not trying to do what we're doing; they have different goals like making a comic book or working a regular job. Fundamental laws of creativity and accomplishment apply across different fields, whether it's YouTube, poetry, music, or law.</p>

<h2>Community and Motivation</h2>

<p>Seeing improvement in art is addicting and self-gratifying, which motivates continued effort. Traditional oil painting and academic drawing offer a strong feedback loop of improvement. Improvement in any skill feels good and motivates further effort. The journey is more important than the destination; achieving a large number of subscribers is not the ultimate goal. Finding love and enjoyment in the process, like rendering a video or paying attention to sound settings, is crucial. I watch my videos more than anyone else because I enjoy the process of making them. The intention behind creating content includes personal satisfaction and audience engagement.</p>

<h2>Personal Goals and Flexibility</h2>

<p>Going back to fundamentals, like studying basic shapes, is important for improvement. The advent of AI and instant gratification makes traditional media art feel foreign due to its slow practice and improvement loop. Despite technological advances, interest in drawing and traditional art is growing. The rate of improvement in fine art is not linear; it involves plateaus and significant level-ups. Improvement feels like leveling up in stages rather than a constant, gradual increase. The universe might be telling us to stop caring so much about what's happening with others and focus on our own learning process.</p>

<h2>Execution and Follow-Through</h2>

<p>Learning to draw or play the piano takes a lot of time and effort. Being bad at something is a significant part of the learning process. To learn how to draw, one should step outside themselves and be okay with who they are. Humbling oneself and doing the work is challenging but necessary. It's harder to learn new skills as one gets older due to increased ego. Lowering expectations can be a practical approach when balancing multiple interests. Comparison with others is a significant challenge in both business and personal growth. Focusing on oneself is the ideal approach, but it's easier said than done. Overconfidence can hinder growth and the ability to absorb feedback. Listening to others' opinions is crucial for improvement. There's a balance between taking feedback and learning for oneself. Surrounding oneself with the best can be discouraging due to high expectations. Motivation should come from within rather than external comparisons. Surrounding oneself with equally motivated peers can be more beneficial than being near the best. Communities and like-minded friends are important for growth.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Success can be achieved in various ways, not just by following established paradigms. Everyone, including successful people, looks for ways to improve. Finding tangible ways to stop comparing oneself to others and becoming more disciplined is a personal journey. Connecting with others and being open to conversations can be beneficial. One's personal goals and desires should guide their actions. Small successes can build confidence and understanding of what works. Many people struggle with figuring out what they want to do, especially at a young age. Interests can evolve over time, and one should be open to new passions. Not tying one's identity to a specific role or activity allows for greater freedom. Following interests rather than financial efficiency can lead to greater success and longevity. Executing a project involves preparation, hard work, and maintaining quality throughout. Finishing what one starts is crucial, even when doubts arise. The advice is to just do it and follow through with projects.</p>
