<p>Drawing vehicles is an excellent way to practice cylinders and to reinforce what we've learned about boxes. It's a fun and effective method to improve your understanding of these forms in perspective.</p>

<h2><strong>Project Overview</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Level One: Simple Vehicles</strong></h3>

<p>Your first project is to draw a simple car, bus, RV, or truck. You could even choose a monster truck if you want to focus more on the wheels. I particularly like the idea of an RV or a truck because you can add a spare tire on the front or the back, giving you the chance to practice cylinders in two different orientations: those going side to side and the spare going front to back.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use photos for inspiration</strong>: Look at photos to understand the vehicle you're drawing, but don't copy the exact shapes. You're not drawing the reference; you're using it as inspiration. I want you to draw the vehicle from a slightly different angle than what's in the reference to force you to construct the perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Simplify the form</strong>: Make your vehicles almost toy-like. Simplify and remove all those subtle curves and details. Treat the body very similarly to how we drew the arcade cabinets. Start with a simple silhouette in perspective and then extrude it, but this time in three-point perspective. Don't worry about the exact proportions because toy cars come in all sorts of exaggerated shapes.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on perspective</strong>: Focus more on the accurate perspective of the form. Approximate the square planes around where the wheels will go and construct an ellipse in it as shown in the previous lesson. Make sure to extrude them to give them some thickness. You can draw the same vehicle from several different angles or try a bunch of different types of vehicles, whatever seems the most fun to you.</li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>Level Two: Including a Tank</strong></h3>

<p>After you've done as many of the level one drawings as you'd like, make sure to include at least one tank. Tanks are great for this exercise because you have cylinders along all three axes: a bunch of wheels side to side, the turret up and down, and the barrel or the gun goes forward and back. The barrel can be a wild card because you can turn it in any direction. </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Constructing the tank</strong>: Tanks come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, so have fun with it, but try to construct yours primarily out of boxes and cylinders. I'll allow this somewhat triangular form if you want to include the smaller wheels on the ends. And there's all sorts of simple things you can add on to make it more cool like headlights, a window, or more guns.</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Drawing Techniques and Tips</strong></h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Keep lines light and clean</strong>: In the early stages of your drawing, keep your lines light and clean. As you probably already know, mess can get out of control real quick, and it's very difficult to construct a nice cylinder inside of a messy base.</li>

<li><strong>Constructing ellipses for wheels</strong>: Make sure to extrude the ellipses to give them some thickness. This will help in creating a more realistic representation of the wheels.</li>

<li><strong>Drawing from different angles</strong>: You can draw the same vehicle from several different angles or try a bunch of different types of vehicles. This practice will enhance your understanding of perspective and form.</li>

<li><strong>Ensuring consistent wheel size</strong>: Use the X method to make sure your wheels are a consistent size. This technique is crucial for maintaining proportion and accuracy in your drawings.</li>

<li><strong>Use x-ray vision goggles</strong>: Remember to put on your x-ray vision goggles. A lot of the stuff that we've learned is going to come together here, and it's going to be really useful.</li>

</ul>

<p>Practicing drawing vehicles is crucial for mastering cylinders and boxes in perspective. It's a fun and engaging way to reinforce these fundamental concepts. If you need to review anything, go back and re-watch the lessons. Keep practicing, and you'll see significant improvements in your drawing skills.</p>
