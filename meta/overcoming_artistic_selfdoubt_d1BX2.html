<p>I've had moments where I felt proud of my artwork one day, only to question it the next. This led me to seek insights from other artists, including Greg Broadmore, a concept designer known for his work on films like <em>District 9</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>King Kong</em>. During a visit to WETA Workshop in Wellington, New Zealand, Greg shared his thoughts on overcoming self-doubt and the importance of reaching a <strong>"flow state"</strong> where intuition guides the creative process, especially in structured works like graphic novels.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Challenges in Art</h2>

<p><strong>Greg and I discussed several challenges artists face, including:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Using alcohol in moderation</strong> to reduce inhibitions and facilitate entering the flow state, though it's not a universal solution.</li>

<li>The <strong>minimal risk of art-making</strong> compared to the fear of judgment, emphasizing that preparation should not hinder the creative process.</li>

<li>The challenge of <strong>comparing oneself to others</strong> on platforms like Instagram, which can add pressure to measure one's work against others.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Role of Intuition and Authenticity</h2>

<p><strong>In our conversation, Greg highlighted several key points about intuition and authenticity in art:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>He meticulously plans his graphic novels, visualizing each panel during the writing process, though the final artwork often diverges from his initial vision.</li>

<li>Greg believes in using <strong>visual storytelling techniques</strong> to amplify the narrative, some of which emerge accidentally but are then intentionally enhanced.</li>

<li>His approach to comic books is driven by a desire to explore <strong>personal and universal truths</strong> rather than aiming for commercial success, prioritizing authenticity over marketability.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Practical Advice for Artists</h2>

<p><strong>Greg and I shared practical advice for artists, including:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The importance of <strong>starting projects without making excuses</strong>, emphasizing that beginning without a clear plan or confidence is crucial.</li>

<li>The <strong>interconnectedness of different forms of creativity</strong>, as my music influences my art, showing how various creative forms can inspire each other.</li>

<li><strong>Coping with doubt and fear</strong> during the creative process is essential, and avoiding creation due to these feelings is a common form of procrastination.</li>

<li>My love for punk music, especially The Misfits, influenced my approach to art, embracing a spirit of making do with what you have.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Value of Art and Sharing Your Work</h2>

<p><strong>We also discussed the value of art and the importance of sharing one's work:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Art is a form of <strong>self-discovery and expression</strong>, with its value independent of commercial success or popularity.</li>

<li>The <strong>intrinsic value of art</strong> should be the primary motivation, beyond considering it as a career.</li>

<li>Sharing one's art can be challenging but is necessary for <strong>personal growth, competition, and ultimately, making a living</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Coping with the highs and lows</strong> of artistic success and failure is crucial, as is maintaining a balance between self-criticism and self-appreciation.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Reflecting on my conversation with Greg Broadmore and my own experiences, I've learned that the creative journey is a lifelong pursuit of discovering one's truth through art. It involves intuition, confronting challenges, and embracing the interconnectedness of different forms of creativity. Starting is crucial, and the more you push past hesitation, the better you'll become. The value of art must be intrinsic, and sharing your work, despite the challenges, is essential for growth and connection with others.</p>
