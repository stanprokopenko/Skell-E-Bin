      <p>Hey, welcome back. We’ve been drawing a lot of boxes, and now we’re moving on cylinders. Which, funny enough, also involves boxes.</p>
      <h2>Ovals vs ellipses</h2>
      <p>A lot of people seem to be confused about the difference between the two, so let’s get that out of the way..</p>
      <p>All ellipses are ovals. But not all ovals are ellipses. An egg-like oval is not an ellipse. Ellipses must have 4 equal quadrants.</p>
      <p>To fit an ellipse inside the square plane, look for a few key clues:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>A circle inside a square always touches the square at the middle of every edge, creating four points of contact. To find the exact midpoints, I use the <strong>X method</strong>. The intersection of the X helps us find the centers of all the edges.</li>
      <li>The minor axis is at the same angle as the receding lines of the box and crosses the center point.</li>
      <li>The major axis is perpendicular to the minor axis. It doesn't pass through the exact center of the square; it's slightly farther away due to foreshortening.</li>
      </ol>
