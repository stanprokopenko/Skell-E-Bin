<p>I painted a small piece on my Nintendo DS when I was first learning these concepts. The light source in the painting is very warm, clearly separating light from shadows. Understanding light and shadow is crucial in painting, as it helps create depth and realism.</p>

<h2>Warm and Cool Colors</h2>

<p>Warm and cool colors play a significant role in painting. Direct light, like sunlight, is warm compared to the blue and purple environment. In my painting, directly lit colors are warm, while shadows are cooler, moving towards greens, blues, and some reds. The warm direct light color is close to gray, not highly saturated. The hue of the light colors remains consistent across different surfaces, while shadows show more variation in hue and saturation, existing in cooler greens, cyan blues, and hints of cooler reds. </p>

<p>In a cartoony illustration, colors are exaggerated but based on reality. For example, a monster character demonstrates using hue and saturation to transition between warm and cool temperatures. The light source is the sun, with the belly lit by sunlight and the rest in shadow influenced by the blue sky. Despite the monster being green, the light makes it appear yellowish due to the comparison with cooler green shadows.</p>

<h2>Using the Color Wheel</h2>

<p>The color wheel is a valuable tool for understanding color relationships. Warm colors in light are pinned to a specific area on the color wheel, allowing for a range of applicable colors. Shadows move through the color wheel towards cooler greens and blues, even reaching purples. Shadow hues are influenced by the blue sky, especially on upward-facing areas. Areas less exposed to the sky have warmer greens, still cooler than the greens in light.</p>

<p>Early exercises involved simple subjects to practice color temperature without complex drawing. Swatch studies helped understand color relationships by abstracting them from the picture. Shadows are free from the bully influence, showing different paths to cooler colors.</p>

<h2>Practical Examples</h2>

<h3>Monster Character Painting</h3>

<p>In the monster character painting, warm light and cool shadows are evident. The light source is the sun, with the belly lit by sunlight and the rest in shadow influenced by the blue sky. The local color green is influenced by light and shadow, creating a range of transition colors. The monster's shadows move through the color wheel towards cooler greens and blues, even reaching purples.</p>

<h3>Green Grass Painting</h3>

<p>In a painting with green grass, warm light and cool shadows are also present. The green grass in warm sunlight is influenced by the warm sun, while the green grass in shadow is pushed away from the warms. Unlike the monster painting, the hilltop is seen from a relative distance, so fewer colors were used. This was an aesthetic choice to maintain visual appeal.</p>

<h2>Color Temperature in Different Elements</h2>

<h3>Water</h3>

<p>Handling color temperature in water follows the same principles. The blue water is lit by warm light, so the hue is pushed towards the warm side. For water in shadow, the hue moves the other way, but not too far, maintaining a balance.</p>

<h3>White Stone Huts</h3>

<p>For white stone huts, the color temperature is managed similarly. In light, the stone might be a very desaturated warm color, influenced by the sunlight. In shadow, the colors travel through the gray, resulting in bluish and purplish hues of various saturations.</p>

<h2>Reflected Light</h2>

<p>Reflected light occurs when direct light bounces off a surface and illuminates another area in shadow. For example, in the monster painting, sunlight bounces off the ground and warms up the monster's belly. This creates a warm and cool play within the shadows.</p>

<h2>Advanced Color Relationships</h2>

<p>In a more complex painting with a green monster and a girl character, the relationship of warm versus cool colors is pushed further. The warm light influences both the monster and the girl, despite their different local colors. To balance the warm light, shadows are pushed colder. </p>

<p>Building paths from warm to cool using intermediary colors helps create a smooth transition. For instance, sampling colors from the girl's face and the monster's head in shadow shows a progression from warm to cool.</p>

<p>Understanding and applying color temperature in painting involves recognizing the influence of light and shadow on colors. Using the color wheel, practicing with simple subjects, and studying swatches can help master these principles. When choosing photo references, select ones with clear delineation of light and shadow to remove guesswork. In the next video, we'll dive into demonstrations to further explore these concepts.</p>
