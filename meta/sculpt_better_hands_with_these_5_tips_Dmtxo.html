<h2>Practical Tips for Sculpting Better Hands</h2>

<h3>Tip #1: Use Your Own Hands as a Reference</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Observe and use your own hands</strong> for reference. Utilize mirrors and a sculptor's cheat sheet to check proportions, placement of knuckles, joints, and more.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tip #2: Start with Simple Shapes or Basic Forms</h3>

<ul>

<li>Begin by <strong>blocking out basic shapes</strong> using geometric forms and pay attention to the rhythms of the hand.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tip #3: Focus on Proportions</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Understand and apply correct proportions</strong> of fingers and palm. A common beginner mistake is incorrect hand proportions.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tip #4: Add Details Gradually</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Build up details</strong> from bony features to fleshy forms in a sequence: bones, muscles and fat pads, then wrinkles and veins.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tip #5: Study Anatomy</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>A deep understanding of anatomy</strong> is crucial. Focus on bones, joints, tendons, fat pads, and skin.</li>

</ul>
