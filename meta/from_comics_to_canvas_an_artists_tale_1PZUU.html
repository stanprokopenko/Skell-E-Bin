<h2>Early Influences and Inspiration</h2>

<p>I got hooked on comics around fourth or fifth grade, starting with my sister's Archie comics. My fascination quickly expanded to include TV shows like the old Hulk, which inspired me to draw my own Hulk comic. Discovering the art of legends like Frazetta and Rockwell opened my eyes to a world beyond cartoons and comics. Anime and manga, such as Macross 7, He-Man, She-Ra, and Heathcliff, further captivated me and deepened my interest in art. But it was Jim Lee's X-Men #1 that truly blew my mind with its art style and storytelling, cementing my desire to draw comics.</p>

<h2>Transition to Professional Artistry</h2>

<p>I've always considered myself a global artist, eager to explore a wide range of art forms, from paper mache to digital sculpting in ZBrush. My path to becoming a penciler was shaped by the industry's demands, and I learned a great deal by working closely with mentors like Jim Lee at Image Comics.</p>

<h2>Creative Process and Techniques</h2>

<p><strong>Digital vs. Traditional Penciling:</strong> I see little difference between digital and traditional penciling, except for the convenience of the undo feature in digital work. </p>

<p><strong>Staying Fresh:</strong> To avoid stagnation, I occasionally switch to different creative activities, like painting, regardless of my workload. </p>

<p><strong>Live Streaming Commissions:</strong> Live streaming my commission work forces me to complete projects, preventing them from being indefinitely shelved.</p>

<p><strong>Superhero Design:</strong> Understanding basic superhero design patterns is crucial for creative manipulation and innovation in character design.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Challenges and Staying Motivated</h2>

<p><strong>Dealing with Burnout:</strong> To combat burnout, I've found that disconnecting, such as taking vacations after events like San Diego Comic-Con or walking the Grand Canyon, helps rejuvenate my creativity.</p>

<p><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> My confidence comes from a relentless hunger to learn and master new skills, pushing myself to continuously grow as an artist. The vast yet small art industry, coupled with technological advancements, offers limitless possibilities for artists.</p>
