<h2>Background and Early Exposure to Comics</h2>

<p>Aletha Martinez, a comic book artist with a 21-year career at Marvel, grew up in Curacao where comic books were virtually non-existent. Despite this, she always had a burning passion for storytelling. Her first encounter with comics was through a Spider-Man ash can brought by missionaries, which transported her and reminded her of being in America. She was later inspired by Jim Lee's X-Men artwork, which she had to secretly purchase and hide from her disapproving grandmother.</p>

<h3>Challenges and Pushback</h3>

<p>Aletha faced tremendous pushback from her family regarding her interest in comics. She had to hide her passion and draw in secret, as her family did not support her artistic pursuits. They refused to buy her drawing paper and discouraged her from drawing on her schoolwork, believing it was not a serious endeavor.</p>

<h2>Journey to Becoming a Comic Book Artist</h2>

<p>Determined to follow her dreams, Aletha moved to New York with just a duffle bag and a guitar. She had heard about the School of Visual Arts, founded by Will Eisner, and applied with the hope of honing her skills and breaking into the comic book industry.</p>

<h3>Experience at the School of Visual Arts</h3>

<p>As the only girl in the cartooning department, Aletha faced harassment and discrimination from her male classmates. They questioned her dedication and belittled her presence, ultimately leading her to leave the school after a year and a half. Undeterred, she became a self-taught artist and continued to pursue her passion.</p>

<h2>Teaching and Mentoring the Next Generation</h2>

<p>Now, as a teacher at the School of Visual Arts, Aletha witnesses a significant cultural shift. Her classes are 95% girls, with only a few boys each year. She strives to create a safe space for women to explore their creativity and tell their stories. However, she notices that many of her students find a "happy place" and don't push themselves to reach for the top tier of the industry, where drawing for Marvel is a highly competitive "1% club."</p>

<h3>Advice for Aspiring Comic Book Artists</h3>

<p>Aletha emphasizes three essential qualities for success in the comic book industry: discipline, stamina, and conviction. She advises her students to draw every day, even when sick or facing adversity, to build their stamina. She encourages them to persist in their passion, even if faced with the possibility of plagiarism or lack of recognition. Aletha believes that the fire within artists and creators is something that no machine can replicate, and no one who hasn't experienced it can understand.</p>

<h2>Approach to Storytelling and Character Design</h2>

<p>In her work, Aletha brings her personal experiences to the story, grounding characters in relatable, realistic details rather than inserting herself into the narrative. She conducts research to design characters appropriate to their culture and environment, such as dressing warriors practically for their climate and covering the hair of women of color at night. These subtle touches help readers connect with the characters, even if they are not familiar with comics.</p>

<h3>Favorite Characters and Types of Stories</h3>

<p>Aletha has a deep love for the character Namor, whom she has adored since first discovering him. She is drawn to epic battle scenes and stories where evil is vanquished, enjoying the feeling of seeing justice served. While she appreciates complex characters like Namor, who are not entirely wicked, she prefers stories with a strong forward momentum.</p>

<h2>Reflections on Her Journey and Progress in the Industry</h2>

<p>Looking back, Aletha recognizes her younger self's unwavering focus and determination in pursuing her dreams despite the challenges she faced. Rather than wishing to go back and advise her younger self, she believes that her younger self should come to her and remind her of the ongoing fight for equality in the comic book industry.</p>

<p>Aletha has witnessed progress for women in comics, with less doubt about their abilities compared to when she started. However, she emphasizes that the fight is not over and requires continued effort to prevent sliding backward.</p>

<h3>The Freedom and Responsibility of Being a Comic Book Artist</h3>

<p>For Aletha, being a comic book artist is a "golden ticket" to experience and draw all types of stories. She embraces the versatility required of artists in the industry, as they must be able to draw anything from dragons to everyday life. Comics provide a unique opportunity for storytelling and personal expression, and Aletha feels fortunate to have found her calling in this field.</p>
