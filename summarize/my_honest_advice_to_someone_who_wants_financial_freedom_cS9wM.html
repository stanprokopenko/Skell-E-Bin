<h2>Understanding Financial Freedom</h2>

<p><strong>Financial freedom</strong> is a <strong>subjective goal</strong> that varies greatly among individuals. It's both a psychological and social construct, influenced by personal desires, lifestyle aspirations, and the cost of living in one's area. For some, it might mean the ability to work part-time or pursue hobbies without financial stress, while for others, it could involve having a significant amount of money in the bank.</p>

<p>The <strong>importance of identifying personal reasons</strong> for seeking financial freedom cannot be overstated. It's crucial to understand what specific desires or needs one hopes to fulfill through achieving financial freedom. This understanding helps in setting a clear and meaningful goal that aligns with one's aspirations and lifestyle costs.</p>

<p><strong>Financial freedom varies</strong> by individual aspirations and lifestyle costs. It can be achieved with different amounts of money, depending on one's lifestyle costs and aspirations. For instance, someone living in a high-cost area might need more financial resources to feel financially free compared to someone in a lower-cost area. Similarly, an individual's personal goals, such as traveling the world or simply having more free time, will also dictate the amount of money needed to achieve financial freedom.</p>

<p>In summary, financial freedom is a highly personal goal that depends on an individual's unique aspirations and the cost of their desired lifestyle. Identifying the specific reasons behind the desire for financial freedom is essential for setting a realistic and fulfilling goal.</p>

<h2>Setting Financial Goals</h2>

<p>I transitioned from working as a doctor in the UK's National Health Service, where I earned about Â£40,000 ($50,000) a year, to focusing full-time on my YouTube channel and business. Over the past 7 years, I've shared my journey from a medical student and junior doctor to becoming a full-time entrepreneur and author, achieving what I consider financial freedom. This transition underscores the importance of setting and pursuing clear financial goals.</p>

<p><strong>Defining a clear financial goal</strong> is crucial. For me, financial freedom initially meant the ability to work part-time as a doctor to earn a bit extra each month, reducing financial stress and affording more free time. The goal of financial freedom varies greatly among individuals, influenced by personal goals, lifestyle aspirations, and living costs. It's essential to identify the specific reasons behind the desire for financial freedom and what one hopes it will provide.</p>

<p>I use the <strong>GPS framework: Goal, Plan, System</strong> to outline my approach to achieving my goals. This involves identifying the goal, planning how to achieve it, and establishing a system to stick to the plan. For example, my goal for financial freedom is to have a million in the bank in the next 8 years, which requires me to reverse engineer the goal to save $125,000 each year. This means I need to make around $200,000 a year to save $125,000 after taxes and expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting goals or plans as needed</strong> is a part of the process. If my current plan is not aligned with my goal, it sets me up for unhappiness and failure. It's okay to change my goal if I realize it's not what I truly want, as pursuing the wrong goal can lead to wasted time and effort. When faced with a discrepancy between my goal and plan, I must decide whether to change the goal or the plan. This alignment is crucial for living a fulfilling and meaningful life.</p>

<h2>Achieving Financial Freedom</h2>

<p><strong>Reverse engineering financial goals</strong> is a method I use to achieve financial freedom. It involves breaking down the final goal into yearly, monthly, or even daily targets. For instance, to have a million in the bank in 8 years, I need to save $125,000 each year, which means earning around $200,000 a year to save that amount after taxes and expenses. This approach helps in setting clear, actionable steps towards the goal.</p>

<p><strong>The significance of personal growth and skill development</strong> cannot be understated in the journey to financial freedom. Achieving such goals often requires changing one's identity, aspirations, and even daily habits. It's about growing as a person and developing the skills necessary to navigate the path to financial freedom successfully.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge vs. execution problems in achieving goals</strong> is a critical distinction. Many people have the desire for financial freedom but lack the knowledge of viable paths to achieve it or the execution skills to follow through. Understanding the different paths and knowing what actions to take is essential for success. If you can list at least 10 viable paths to your goal, choose the one with the highest success probability and test it. If you can't list 10 paths, you're facing a knowledge problem.</p>

<p><strong>Viable paths to financial freedom</strong> and the importance of choosing the right one are crucial considerations. Starting and growing your own business is often more effective than working for someone else, due to the limited financial growth potential in most jobs. However, not all business models are equally viable. For example, tutoring companies, while common among university-educated individuals, are generally not the best model for significant financial gain, especially when targeting consumers instead of businesses. Understanding the logistics of scaling a business and choosing a model that aligns with your current situation and resources is key to achieving financial freedom.</p>

<p>In summary, achieving financial freedom involves a combination of reverse engineering your financial goals, personal growth, understanding the difference between knowledge and execution problems, and choosing a viable path that aligns with your resources and situation.</p>

<h2>The Role of Education and Resources</h2>

<p><strong>Educating oneself in entrepreneurship</strong> is essential for anyone aspiring to achieve financial freedom or become an entrepreneur. Just like medical professionals undergo extensive education and training before practicing, entrepreneurship and financial success require a similar commitment to learning and skill development. Pursuing financial freedom without educating oneself through books, podcasts, or other resources indicates a lack of understanding of making money as a skill that can be learned and developed.</p>

<p>I <strong>recommend books and podcasts</strong> for aspiring entrepreneurs to help them understand the landscape of entrepreneurship and financial growth. Books such as "The Millionaire Fastlane" by MJ DeMarco, "Million Dollar Weekend" by Noah Kagan, "$100 Million Offers" by Alex Hormozi, and "DotCom Secrets" by Russell Brunson are excellent resources. These books can significantly update one's mindset and approach to achieving their goals. For example, a friend of mine started a software business that now earns $35,000 a month after reading these recommended books. </p>

<p>Listening to podcasts, specifically interviews with entrepreneurs and business coaches, can also provide a "map" to financial freedom. Interviews I've conducted with individuals like Dan Priestley, Robin Waite, Nicholas Cole, and Cody Sanchez are particularly useful. Consuming this content is likened to studying for a test, providing valuable insights and strategies for success.</p>

<p><strong>Learning from successful entrepreneurs</strong> is crucial for progress in business and achieving financial freedom. My business aims to reach $10 million a year, and part of my strategy involves consuming hours of content from successful entrepreneurs to learn and apply their strategies. This includes training myself to listen to audiobooks and podcasts at double speed, effectively doubling my learning time. There's a distinction between reading for exploration and reading for exploitation, which means deeply understanding and applying specific knowledge. Progressing in business, like in any skill, requires learning from those who are more successful and gradually increasing your knowledge and actions as you grow.</p>

<p>In summary, educating oneself through books, podcasts, and learning from successful entrepreneurs is vital for anyone aiming to achieve financial freedom or become an entrepreneur. These resources provide the knowledge and insights needed to navigate the path to success effectively.</p>

<h2>Balancing Life and Entrepreneurship</h2>

<p><strong>Think of myself as an athlete</strong> if I want to be an entrepreneur. It's not just about what I do in my business but also what I do outside of it. Athletes don't just perform on the field; their off-field habits are crucial to their success, which applies to entrepreneurship as well.</p>

<p>It's <strong>important not to sacrifice my life for the sake of my business</strong>. This means taking care of my health, maintaining relationships, having hobbies, and ensuring I have relaxation time. Health is often prioritized first in this balance. The phrase from my friend S Bloom, "there is no such thing as a loser who wakes up at 5:00 a.m.," highlights the importance of discipline and a healthy routine in achieving success.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Prioritize health</strong> as it significantly boosts energy for work, business, and personal life.</li>

<li><strong>Reduce time spent on unproductive activities</strong> like watching TV and scrolling through social media, especially for entrepreneurs aiming for financial freedom.</li>

<li><strong>Extraordinary goals require extraordinary inputs</strong>; reallocating time from leisure to productive activities like reading business books or working on a business is crucial.</li>

<li><strong>Use day jobs to advantage</strong> by utilizing downtime for side hustle activities, such as planning, sketching ideas, or learning.</li>

<li><strong>Surrounding oneself with like-minded individuals</strong> or those who inspire growth can significantly impact one's progress toward their goals.</li>

<li>The <strong>content consumed</strong> plays a significant role in shaping one's mindset and knowledge base towards entrepreneurship and financial freedom.</li>

</ul>

<p>The journey towards financial freedom is long and should be enjoyable; focusing on health and relationships is as important as financial goals. Financial freedom is achievable with the right information, action, and enjoyment of the process, likened to playing a challenging yet rewarding video game.</p>

<h2>Continuous Growth and Enjoyment of the Process</h2>

<p>The journey towards financial freedom is akin to playing a <strong>rewarding game</strong>. It's not just about reaching the end goal but also about <strong>setting and working towards meaningful goals</strong> along the way. This process is crucial for personal fulfillment and happiness.</p>

<p><strong>The importance of continuous challenge and goal elevation</strong> cannot be overstated. As I progress, it's essential to continuously challenge myself and elevate my goals to keep the journey exhilarating and fulfilling. The work involved in entrepreneurship remains consistent across different levels of success; what changes is the scale and the challenges faced.</p>

<p><strong>Following a sensible plan and system for success</strong> is key. This suggests that the path to financial freedom is accessible to those who are committed and willing to put in the effort. By aligning my actions with my future goals and continuously adapting my approach, I can live a fulfilling and meaningful life while pursuing financial freedom.</p>

<p>In summary, the journey towards financial freedom should be enjoyable, with a focus on continuous growth, setting meaningful goals, and enjoying the process. It's about playing a challenging yet rewarding game, where the enjoyment comes from the journey itself, not just the destination.</p>
