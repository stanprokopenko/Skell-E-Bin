<p>In recent years, the landscape of online courses and businesses has shifted dramatically. As someone who has been selling online courses since 2017, I've noticed that simply selling information doesn't work anymore. In 2022, we made a change in our business to not just survive but thrive in this new space, and I want to share with you exactly how to do that.</p>

<h2>The Problem: Selling Information Doesn't Work Anymore</h2>

<p>People aren't buying online courses like they used to. In 2020, we were at the height of online course sales due to the pandemic, but over time, people got overloaded and tired of the abundance of information available. Even those who are buying online courses are seeing abysmal completion rates, with industry-wide rates ranging from 5% to 15%. This means that out of every 100 students who pay for an online course, only 5 to 15 are completing it.</p>

<p>The root cause of this problem is that information is no longer scarce or valuable. There is so much information available online, and most of it is free. We are past the golden era of having information be valuable simply because it exists.</p>

<h2>The Solution: Sell Implementation, Not Just Information</h2>

<p>To succeed in today's online business landscape, we have to think about what is scarce and valuable for people today: <strong>time and implementation</strong>. Instead of selling information, we need to start selling the actual process of doing the thing or getting results from that information.</p>

<p>There are three different ways to sell implementation:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Do it for them (service-based business)</strong>: If you have a skill or expertise that people need, you can offer a service where you do the work for them. This is the quickest way to generate revenue when starting out.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Do it with them (coaching or consulting)</strong>: Instead of doing the work for them, you can walk them through the process and provide accountability. People are more likely to succeed when they have someone guiding them and holding them accountable.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Do it with others (community or cohorts)</strong>: Create spaces where people can go through the process alongside others. Studies have shown that people are more likely to succeed when working with others who are pursuing the same goal.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h3>The Importance of Accountability and Community</h3>

<p>Accountability is the key to success in online courses. It's not enough to just provide information; people need support and guidance to actually implement what they learn. This is where community comes in.</p>

<p>In 2020, we launched our first community, SPI Pro, for higher-level entrepreneurs who want to connect, collaborate, and join mastermind groups. In 2022, we launched our second community, the All Access Pass, for beginners. This community features community-powered courses and accelerators, where people go through the material together on a specific timeline.</p>

<p>The results speak for themselves: in one of our recent accelerators, 110 people signed up, and 40 people finished, resulting in a 36% finish rate. This is a significant improvement over the industry average of 5-15%.</p>

<h2>Tips for Selling Implementation Successfully</h2>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Convert convenience, not just information</strong>: People are willing to pay for convenience, even if the information is available for free elsewhere. Package your expertise in a way that is easy for people to consume and implement.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Differentiate from free information available elsewhere</strong>: Make it clear what sets your offering apart from the free information available online. Highlight the implementation opportunities and support that come with your product.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Provide proof and real-life case studies to support claims</strong>: Use case studies and testimonials to show that your product or service actually works. If you're just starting out, use the "1-1-1 strategy": find one person with one problem and give them one result, then use that as proof to scale up.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>In conclusion, the key to succeeding in online business today is to sell implementation, not just information. By providing accountability, community, and support, you can help your customers achieve their goals and build a thriving business in the process.</p>
