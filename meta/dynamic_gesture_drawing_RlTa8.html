<p>When I approach gesture drawing, my main focus isn't on creating a carbon copy of the reference. Instead, I aim to <strong>capture the movement and dynamic qualities</strong> of the figure. This often means <strong>exaggerating certain aspects</strong> like diagonal directions or lengths to emphasize these qualities. It's all about capturing the essence of the pose, especially when it involves complex actions or emotions, such as a figure deeply engrossed in a book.</p>

<h2>Observing and Starting the Drawing</h2>

<p>The process begins with observing the head. I use <strong>wrapping lines</strong> to suggest the form of the figure, which helps in establishing a sense of volume right from the start. For seated poses or figures that lean forward, I adapt my line orientation to match the pose, creating a sense of forward lean and depth. This method of starting with the head and adapting line orientation is crucial for capturing the initial gesture of the figure.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Perspective and Depth</h2>

<p>To further emphasize perspective and depth, I continue to use wrapping lines throughout the drawing. These lines are adjusted to suggest the form and perspective of different parts of the body. Additionally, I adjust <strong>line weight</strong> to highlight parts of the figure that are closer to the viewer, enhancing the overall sense of depth in the drawing.</p>

<h2>Checking Proportions</h2>

<p>Proportions are key, especially in seated or complex poses. I use the <strong>pelvis as a midpoint reference</strong> to ensure that the legs are in correct proportion to the rest of the body. This helps avoid making the legs appear overly long or short. In foreshortened figures, I shorten the lines representing limbs and use exaggerated wraps with ellipses to convey the effect of foreshortening effectively.</p>

<h2>Refining the Gesture</h2>

<p>After laying down the initial gesture, I take a step back to assess the effectiveness of each line. My goal is to ensure that every line guides the viewer through the figure, creating a cohesive flow from one part to the next. For legs, I adjust the length and curvature of lines to suggest their foreshortened state, using <strong>C curves and S curves</strong> to indicate direction and movement. When drawing arms, especially those under strain or tension, I focus on the shoulder and upper arm, adjusting line weight to convey the pressure exerted by the figure's pose.</p>

<h2>Capturing Tension and Focus</h2>

<p>The intense focus of the figure on the book, with every muscle in his back tensed and his arm straining, guides my approach to capturing the gesture. This tension and focus are reflected throughout the body, influencing how I depict each part of the figure.</p>

<h2>Building Upon the Gesture</h2>

<p>After establishing the gesture, the next steps involve <strong>identifying tilts</strong> and <strong>adding basic 2D shapes</strong> to build upon the initial gesture drawing. This helps in refining the drawing further, adding structure and detail to the dynamic gesture captured in the initial stages.</p>

<p>In summary, the process of drawing figures with dynamic gestures involves a series of steps that focus on capturing the essence and movement of the figure. By emphasizing movement, adjusting lines for perspective, checking proportions, and refining gestures, we can create drawings that are lively and full of character.</p>
