<p>I've been tasked with a unique challenge this week: to work on <strong>32 images</strong> with a focus on <strong>impressionism</strong>. The key here is to capture the essence of each image quickly, which means I'm limited to <strong>15 minutes per image</strong>. This constraint is designed to push me to work swiftly and grasp the overall idea of each scene. The ultimate goal is to complete as many images as possible within this timeframe, with special attention given to <strong>four specific images</strong> we discussed in class.</p>

<h2>Challenges in Mastering Color and Light</h2>

<p>In tackling this assignment, I've identified two major obstacles in mastering color and light:</p>

<ul>

<li>The first challenge is <strong>not knowing what to observe</strong> in terms of light sources, highlights, and shadow qualities. It's crucial to understand these elements to capture the essence of the scene accurately.</li>

<li>The second challenge is the <strong>discouragement from perceived failure</strong> during the painting process. It's common for paintings to look unsatisfactory at some stage, but it's important to remember that perseverance and a positive attitude can lead to a successful outcome.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Homework Objectives and Image Selection</h2>

<p>The primary objective of this homework is to practice with a <strong>large volume of images</strong>. This approach is intended to build confidence in painting any subject by closely observing color and light. To support this goal, <strong>32 images</strong> have been selected based on their <strong>quality of light and composition</strong>, making them suitable for the study of impressionism. This selection process ensures that each image provides a valuable learning opportunity in capturing light and atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Post-Exercise Analysis</h2>

<p>After completing the rapid painting exercise, I'm encouraged to take a step back and <strong>analyze the original reference in detail</strong>. This analysis should focus on understanding the <strong>light sources, highlights, bounce light, contrast</strong>, and other elements that contribute to the scene's atmosphere. This deeper dive into the reference material is crucial for improving my ability to capture the essence of the scene in future paintings.</p>

<h2>Encouragement and Preview of Next Class</h2>

<p>I understand that this assignment comes with its challenges, but it's all part of the learning process. The encouragement to push through and the promise of future improvement are what keep me motivated. Looking ahead, the next class will focus on <strong>painting from imagination</strong>, building upon the foundational skills developed through this exercise. Additional tips will be shared to further aid in the learning process, making this journey an exciting one filled with growth and discovery.</p>
