<p>I've noticed a troubling trend that's been affecting us for the past 24 years, or for some, their entire lives. It's social media, a double-edged sword for artists in the 21st century. I want to talk about the pain and suffering it's caused, and how it's time for us to take back control over our creativity and find fulfillment in our art once again.</p>

<h2>The Problem with Social Media</h2>

<p>Social media platforms prioritize engagement metrics over artistic merit, leading to a devaluation of our hard work. This issue is compounded by societal messages that devalue art from a young age. The cycle of seeking validation through likes and follows can feel like a narcissistic or codependent relationship, where we're constantly chasing a fleeting sense of achievement.</p>

<h2>Personal Journey and Realizations</h2>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I lost touch with my own identity as an artist, trying to mimic others who were more successful on social media. This led to a disconnection from my audience and myself. However, this period also taught me the importance of self-discovery and authenticity in my art.</p>

<h2>The Impact on Mental Health and Creativity</h2>

<p>The pressure to conform to social media trends can lead to mental health challenges, including feelings of dissatisfaction, betrayal, and abandonment. It's crucial to remember that our personal identity is our most valuable asset as artists.</p>

<h2>Reclaiming Creative Autonomy</h2>

<p><strong>It's time to rebel against social media's pressures</strong> and focus on what truly matters: our own growth and authenticity. We need to recognize the intrinsic value of our art and not let it be defined by fleeting social media metrics.</p>

<h2>A Call to Action for Artists</h2>

<p>We must collectively shift towards a more meaningful and balanced approach to creativity. This involves embracing our unique voices and persisting through the challenges of breaking free from social media's constraints. I encourage you to look to artists who have successfully navigated this path for inspiration.</p>

<p>Reclaiming our creative autonomy is not just about fighting against social media; it's about rediscovering the essence of true creativity. It's a difficult journey, but it's one worth taking for the sake of our art and our well-being. Let's not lose sight of why we create and strive to share our true selves with the world.</p>
