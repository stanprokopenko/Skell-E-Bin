<p>Hey guys! Welcome to Proko. My name is Stan Prokopenko. It's been six years since I made my first Loomis head drawing video and since then I've gotten a lot of questions regarding the Loomis method. So I think it's a good time to take a second look at it, do a bunch of quick sketches and give you guys some tips on using the Loomis method that should help you get some better head drawings in quickly. </p>

<p>This is going to be a three part video series:</p>

<ul>

<li>Part 1: Reviewing the basics</li>

<li>Part 2: Adapting Loomis heads to different shapes and proportions </li>

<li>Part 3: Using the Loomis method more intuitively and loosely</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing an Average Loomis Head from the Front</h2>

<ul>

<li>Start with a sphere for the <strong>cranial mass</strong>. </li>

<li><strong>Chop off the sides</strong> of the sphere to create a flat side plane.</li>

<li>Add the <strong>brow line</strong> across the middle of the oval.<ul>

<li>Draw a <strong>parallel line below</strong> for the nose.</li>

<li>Drop <strong>another parallel line</strong> down for the chin.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Attach the jaw</strong> from the brow to the chin.</li>

<li><strong>Divide the jaw</strong> into front and side planes.</li>

</ul>

<p>There you go. There's a nice Loomis head. This is a nice guide to then help me put features on top of that.</p>

<h2>Adapting the Loomis Method for a Head Looking Down</h2>

<ul>

<li>Begin with the <strong>cranial ball</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust the side plane chop</strong> based on the side-to-side turn of the head. </li>

<li><strong>Tilt and narrow the oval</strong> to match the head angle.</li>

<li><strong>Wrap the brow line</strong> around the head following the tilt.</li>

<li>Add <strong>parallel lines</strong> for the nose and chin, accounting for foreshortening.<ul>

<li>The thirds will get smaller as they go away from you, but don't push it too much unless the camera is very close.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Define the <strong>hairline</strong> by curving a parallel line around the top of the head.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing a Perfect Side View Loomis Head</h2>

<ul>

<li>Start with the <strong>cranial ball</strong>.</li>

<li>Place the <strong>side plane oval</strong> in the middle of the circle. <ul>

<li>The side plane is about two-thirds of the height of the full circle.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Drop a line from <strong>forehead to chin</strong> to define the jaw angle.</li>

<li>Add <strong>parallel lines</strong> for the brow, nose, and chin.</li>

<li><strong>Attach the jaw</strong>, ensuring the bottom aligns with the neck.</li>

<li>Note that the <strong>height and depth</strong> of the head are equal from the nose tip to the back of the skull.</li>

</ul>

<p>I like to bring out the muzzle of the lips and teeth, then back in for the chin. From a side view, the eye socket is just a rectangular shape. The top of the cheekbone is like the bottom of the eye socket. I like this rhythm and it goes to the top of the ear.</p>

<h2>Adapting Loomis for Non-Average Proportions</h2>

<p>Now, how do you apply this method on people that don't fit the average proportions? I'll show you tomorrow.</p>
