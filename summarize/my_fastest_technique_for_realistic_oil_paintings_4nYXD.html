<p>When painting roses outdoors, I need to work fast before the light changes. My goal is to achieve a realistic result as quickly as possible. There's no time for any drawing, so I immediately go for the most intense color that I see.</p>

<h2>Mixing Colors for the Rose Petals</h2>

<ul>

<li>I start with the warm yellow-green in the middle of the rose facing me, made with cadmium yellow, viridian, and titanium white.</li>

<li>As I move towards the outsides of the petals, I gradually adjust the color to be cooler and lighter by adding more white, yellow ochre, and viridian.</li>

<li>For shadows under light petals, I mix a darker, more intense green using cadmium yellow, viridian, and yellow ochre.</li>

<li>To carve out light petals, I create a cooler, grayer shadow color with titanium white, viridian, and raw umber.</li>

<li>For subtle variation on lighter petals, I mix a pale gray-violet color using titanium white, ultramarine, alizarin crimson, and a small amount of yellow ochre.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Placing Shadows and Accents</h2>

<ul>

<li>I place a few notes of the pale gray-violet color on some of the lighter petals.</li>

<li>Using a small soft head brush, I add warm dark accents with pure yellow ochre within shadows under small petals.</li>

<li>I use the cool green shadow color to place a few more small shadows under petals.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Simplifying the Subject</h2>

<ul>

<li>I focus on the middle of the rose as the main center of interest.</li>

<li>Due to time constraints, I choose to include only the most obvious details.</li>

<li>By including just a few essential details, I demonstrate how the rose can appear lifelike.</li>

<li>Our attention automatically focuses on small areas of detail, but we never see everything in focus at the same time.</li>

<li>Slavishly copying every detail from a photograph does not result in a truly lifelike appearance.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Softening Edges and Creating Depth</h2>

<ul>

<li>I carve out the outer edges of the petals with a dark green mixture.</li>

<li>Using a large fan brush, I mask in the rest of the background, creating a transparent texture similar to foliage.</li>

<li>I soften edges between the other two roses and the background using paper towel.</li>

<li>With a palette knife, I create a hard edge at the top of the main rose.</li>

<li>To soften some petals, I place a middle-value violet along their edges.</li>

<li>Only some of the hardest, most prominent edges should be included, while the rest are softened to varying degrees.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Blocking in the Other Roses and Leaves</h2>

<ul>

<li>I block in the other two roses facing away from me, mainly in shadow.</li>

<li>I accent one or two petals on the top rose but keep edges soft on the bottom rose.</li>

<li>I consider the different colors visible in the roses: warm and cool greens, and a gray-violet on the underside of some petals.</li>

<li>Using a mixture of viridian, raw umber, and a small amount of alizarin crimson, I place dark shadows amongst the leaves.</li>

<li>By indicating just one or two leaf edges, I demonstrate how they appear more lifelike.</li>

<li>For color variation, I paint some leaves with a warmer, more intense green made with yellow ochre, viridian, and cadmium yellow.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Identifying Main Centers of Interest</h2>

<ul>

<li>Learning to simplify subjects and identify main centers of interest takes practice.</li>

<li>I suggest squinting at the subject and gradually opening your eyes to notice which edges and details pop first.</li>

<li>My ability to finish the painting quickly comes from having painted similar subjects many times and knowing what to look for.</li>
