<p>I've seen firsthand how <strong>AI</strong> has significantly influenced my life, including my career, friendships, business opportunities, and hobbies, all centered around AI. My journey with AI began just before the pandemic, leading me to write books and explore GPT-3 among other AI technologies. Friends and acquaintances across various professions, like law and product management, are also incorporating AI into their work to enhance their practices and careers. The influence of AI on individual lives varies greatly, depending on how actively one chooses to engage with AI technologies.</p>

<h2>AI and Personal Development</h2>

<p>While not everyone will become an AI-focused content creator, many can use AI to augment their careers or improve personal relationships, as some of my supporters have shared. There's a common curiosity about when AI will dramatically change lives, with some hoping for a significant, positive impact without actively seeking it.</p>

<h2>Societal Views on AI</h2>

<p>The effects of AI on employment are mixed, with both overhyped benefits and underplayed downsides, such as job losses, contributing to a narrative of techno-optimism. <strong>Techno-optimism</strong> promotes the belief that more technology is inherently good, but I caution against ignoring the dual-use nature of technology and its potential unintended consequences. Some individuals may already be experiencing negative impacts from AI, particularly in job displacement, while others anticipate future benefits, such as advancements in healthcare and longevity.</p>

<h2>Employment and AI</h2>

<p>The <strong>Biden Administration's investment</strong> in aging research suggests a public interest in making rejuvenation therapies widely accessible, challenging the notion that such advancements would be exclusive to elites. The long-term impact of AI on employment remains uncertain, with the potential for both job displacement and the creation of new opportunities, raising questions about the sustainability of current employment trends in the face of advancing AI capabilities.</p>

<h2>AI in Healthcare</h2>

<p>AI's role in healthcare is expanding, with AI-discovered medications and treatments promising to address aging and other health issues more effectively in the near future. The Biden Administration's focus on AI in healthcare and aging highlights a significant shift towards leveraging technology for public health advancements.</p>

<h2>AI in Entertainment and Creativity</h2>

<p>Personal anecdotes and observations suggest that AI's influence on work, healthcare, and entertainment is rapidly evolving, with significant developments expected in personalized content and dynamic gaming experiences. The integration of AI in video games and potentially in movie production, using gaming engines for visual effects and AI for scriptwriting, indicates a blending of technology and creativity.</p>

<h2>Reflections and Future Considerations</h2>

<p>These reflections, shared post-Thanksgiving, invite further discussion and consideration of how AI continues to shape our lives and society. The uncertain long-term impact of AI on employment and society underscores the need for ongoing dialogue and thoughtful engagement with AI technologies.</p>
