<p>As an immigrant, I've always been fascinated by how easily children seem to pick up new languages compared to adults. Even though adults are generally more competent in most areas, when it comes to learning a language, children outshine their parents. This observation led me to investigate the concept of a critical period for language acquisition and to conduct a large-scale study using an online language quiz.</p>

<h2>Children's Advantage in Language Acquisition</h2>

<p>It's often obvious that children have an advantage over adults in learning languages, especially in immigrant families. While parents struggle with the language of their adopted community, their children acquire it with ease. My mother, who grew up in a Yiddish-speaking household, quickly picked up English and even started correcting her parents' mistakes.</p>

<p>Interestingly, children pay preferential attention to language input from their peers compared to their parents. They learn better from other kids on the playground than from the heavily accented and often error-prone speech of their immigrant parents.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Proving the Existence of a Critical Period</h3>

<p>Despite the intuitive belief that the ability to learn a language declines with age, it's not easy to scientifically prove the existence of a critical period. Many factors differentiate children from adults, making it challenging to isolate the effect of brain plasticity on language learning. Additionally, the literature is vague about the exact age range of the critical period, with estimates ranging from 0-5 years old to a couple of years after puberty.</p>

<p>Another complicating factor is the length of time it takes to learn a language. If you compare immigrants who start learning English at different ages, you must consider how many years they've had to learn the language and how many of those years fell within the optimal learning period.</p>

<h2>The Online Language Quiz Study</h2>

<p>To shed light on this problem, my former students Josh Hartshorne and Josh Tenenbaum created an online language quiz designed to identify English dialects. The quiz went viral, gathering data from 2/3 of a million people, many of whom had acquired English as a second language. This large dataset allowed us to investigate the critical window for language acquisition better than previous studies with much smaller sample sizes.</p>

<h3>Study Findings</h3>

<p>Our analysis revealed some surprising results:</p>

<ol>

<li>It takes approximately 30 years to master the intricacies of a language, according to the quiz results.</li>

<li>Immigrants who start learning English after age 12 never reach native-like proficiency.</li>

<li>The underlying ability to learn a language starts to decline around age 17, based on mathematical analysis of the data.</li>

<li>We found no advantage for boys over girls in language learning, despite girls typically undergoing puberty earlier.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Unanswered Questions and Limitations</h3>

<p>While our study provided valuable insights, some questions remain unanswered. We don't know what causes the change in language learning ability at age 17, whether it's due to changes in social life or brain wiring. Additionally, our study did not test for accent or pronunciation, which may have a different critical window than vocabulary, syntax, and semantics.</p>

<p>In conclusion, our large-scale study using an online language quiz confirmed the existence of a critical period for language acquisition, but surprisingly, it lasts much longer than previously thought â€“ until around age 17. This finding challenges the notion that early childhood or puberty marks the end of the optimal language learning window. However, more research is needed to understand the factors that contribute to this change in language learning ability and to explore the critical period for different aspects of language, such as pronunciation.</p>
