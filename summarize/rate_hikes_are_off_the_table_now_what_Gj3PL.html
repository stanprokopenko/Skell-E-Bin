<h2>Current Market Conditions and Expectations</h2>

<p>The recent Fed meeting has led to a realization in the market that multiple rate cuts are unlikely, and we are in a "higher for longer" interest rate environment. However, a flat market around interest rates allows things to settle down, which could be good news for real estate investors.</p>

<h3>10-Year Treasury Chart Analysis</h3>

<p>Looking at the 3-month chart of the 10-year Treasury, we see a relatively flat line with small fluctuations. Current rates are close to the October 2023 highs, within 20-30 basis points. The market reaction is less pronounced compared to October, as people adjust to the current rate levels.</p>

<h2>Opportunities for Real Estate Investors</h2>

<p>A flat cost of capital, meaning stable interest rates, is not necessarily bad for investors. Those who do the work, follow up, look at days on market, and write disrespectful offers can find great deals in this market. Buying at current prices may provide future gains when rates eventually drop, as the current market could be a stabilization point or potential bottom.</p>

<h3>Long-Term Wealth Building Strategy</h3>

<p>Real estate investing is a 10-year journey, and it's essential to focus on long-term gains rather than short-term fluctuations. Inflation can be a feature, not a bug, in wealth building, as it helps with mortgage pay down over time.</p>

<h2>Loan Options for Investors</h2>

<p>There are several loan options available for real estate investors, including:</p>

<ul>

<li>DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) loans</li>

<li>Bank statement loans</li>

<li>Profit and loss (P&amp;L) loans</li>

</ul>

<h3>Advantages of Non-Traditional Loans</h3>

<p>Non-traditional loans offer flexibility for self-employed borrowers and real estate investors. They allow qualification based on bank statements or P&amp;L rather than tax returns, potentially increasing purchasing power and expanding the buy box. While these loans may be more expensive, the benefits can outweigh the costs for many investors.</p>

<h2>The Power of Other People's Money (OPM)</h2>

<p>Using other people's money (OPM) is key to turbocharging a real estate portfolio. Understanding and managing risks is important when utilizing OPM. Convoy Home Loans offers a variety of lending options to suit different situations, acting as a "Swiss army knife" of lenders.</p>
