<h2><strong>Early Career and Opportunities</strong></h2>

<p>I've been part of the comic industry for nearly two decades. My journey began at Heroes Con in Charlotte, North Carolina, a convention that remains dear to me. It was there I met many aspiring creators, including Jonathan Hickman and Scotty Young, who have since become prominent figures. My early work involved small projects for Dark Horse Comics and DC Comics, which were great for someone just starting out. The key to gradually getting more opportunities was <strong>persistence, hard work, and staying connected</strong> with those who showed interest in my work.</p>

<h2><strong>Inspirations and Early Love for Comics</strong></h2>

<p>My fascination with comics started at the age of six when my mom bought me a comic book from a local store. This sparked an obsession with the medium, although my passion for art itself came even earlier. I was initially drawn to comics as they offered still images that were easier to learn from compared to cartoons. A significant moment for me as a young black kid was seeing Luke Cage, a hero who shared my skin color, among other famous superheroes. This made me want to learn more about him and inspired me to draw him.</p>

<h2><strong>Significant Contributions and Character Reimagining</strong></h2>

<p>The opportunity to reimagine Luke Cage for Marvel felt like a dream come true, especially with the upcoming TV series in mind. I drew inspiration from my friendship with Mike Colter, the actor playing Luke Cage, and aimed to blend elements from men's fashion with traditional Marvel hero visuals in my designs for Luke Cage and Danny Rand. For Danny Rand, I opted for an "Enter the Dragon" tracksuit aesthetic to create a unique visual.</p>

<h2><strong>Impact and Representation</strong></h2>

<p>Currently, I'm a huge fan of Miles Morales and Black Panther because of the impact they have on black and brown kids worldwide. These characters represent more than just superheroes; they are symbols of representation and inspiration for countless young fans. My journey in the comic industry, from my early career to my significant contributions, has been deeply influenced by the desire to see and create characters that reflect the diversity of their readership.</p>
