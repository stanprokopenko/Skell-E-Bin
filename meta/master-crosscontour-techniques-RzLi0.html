<h2>General Advice on Sketching</h2>

<p><strong>Importance of Practice for Improvement</strong></p>

<p>Keep practicing, and you'll get better at it. The more you practice, the more you'll be able to visualize the forms and get those lines to wrap around correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Visualization of Forms and Wrapping Lines Correctly</strong></p>

<p>The body of the lobster looks pretty good. The cross contours on the tail are wrapping around nicely. Just keep working on it.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Cross Contours for Better Results</strong></p>

<p>Use little lines representing cross contours on the inside for better results. This helps in making random blobs feel like 3D forms with consistent cross-contours.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion to Use Red or Blue Pencils for Sketching Big Masses</strong></p>

<p>Try using a red or blue pencil to lightly sketch big masses and adjust slowly. This can help in visualizing the forms better.</p>

<p><strong>Reference to Dynamic Sketching Lessons</strong></p>

<p>Refer to dynamic sketching lessons for practicing different versions of sketching lines. This can help in thinking of large simple forms translating into larger three-dimensional forms.</p>

<h2>Feedback for Individual Artists</h2>

<h3>Reisen</h3>

<p><strong>Praised Three-Dimensional Work</strong></p>

<p>Reisen's three-dimensional work is impressive. No critique needed here.</p>

<h3>Brandon</h3>

<p><strong>Critiqued Hammerhead Shark and Giraffe</strong></p>

<p>Brandon's hammerhead shark and giraffe had heavy cross-contour lines and strange spacing. Focus on showing muscle form based on photo reference, and concentrate on major forms rather than anatomical accuracy.</p>

<h3>Martin</h3>

<p><strong>Praised Line Quality and Control of Line Weight</strong></p>

<p>Martin's line quality and control of line weight are commendable. The cross-contours are accurate.</p>

<h3>Pedro</h3>

<p><strong>Advised Breaking Down Subjects into Forms</strong></p>

<p>Pedro should break down subjects into forms more to avoid stiffness and flatness. The execution of tight curves on the shark and the simplification of the shell into planes were well done. Simplify the front plane of the shell for better structure.</p>

<h3>Juice</h3>

<p><strong>Advised Approaching with More Confidence</strong></p>

<p>Juice should approach with more confidence and use the shoulder more for better line quality.</p>

<h3>Ricin</h3>

<p><strong>Praised Bulbous Forms and Choice of Ginger Roots</strong></p>

<p>Ricin's bulbous forms and the decision to do ginger roots for better form visualization were praised. Treat overlapping contours as separate parts.</p>

<h3>Patrick</h3>

<p><strong>Highlighted Tip on Cross-Contours</strong></p>

<p>Patrick's tip on avoiding all cross-contours leading to the same pinch area for better depth was highlighted.</p>

<h3>Mon Barker</h3>

<p><strong>Commented on Strange and Unique References</strong></p>

<p>Mon Barker found some strange and unique references.</p>

<h3>Alan</h3>

<p><strong>Praised Fish Sketch</strong></p>

<p>Alan's fish sketch was praised. It was noted that the same reference was used by another artist. Make the fins feel flat rather than thick and fluffy.</p>

<h2>Tips for Improving Form Visualization and Line Quality</h2>

<p><strong>Thinking of Large Simple Forms</strong></p>

<p>Think of large simple forms translating into larger three-dimensional forms. Visualize simple primary forms before secondary and tertiary forms.</p>

<p><strong>Making Random Blobs Feel Like 3D Forms</strong></p>

<p>Make random blobs feel like 3D forms with consistent cross-contours.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Additional Axes for More Active Lines</strong></p>

<p>Add additional axes for more active lines in characters.</p>

<p><strong>Treating Overlapping Contours as Separate Parts</strong></p>

<p>Treat overlapping contours as separate parts to enhance depth.</p>

<p><strong>Showing Roundness of Edges</strong></p>

<p>Show the roundness of edges for a more bloated pancake effect.</p>

<p>I appreciate all the submissions. Stay tuned for a separate video on ginger root characters. Keep practicing and refining your skills!</p>
