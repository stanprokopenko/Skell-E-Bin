<h2>Studying Anatomy in Two Stages</h2>

<p>When drawing creatures, it's helpful to study anatomy in two stages:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Stage 1: Bone structure</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Example: For cats, study the shoulder blade, the bone that juts back, the elbow, and the arm bones down to the wrist and paw.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Stage 2: Form</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>This is the simplistic version of what we see on the outside.</li>

<li>Example: A cat's arm is a tube shape that's wider at the top, narrowing down to the wrist, and turning into the paw.</li>

<li>Combine the knowledge of the bone with the simple outside form for a comprehensive understanding.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Creating Fantasy Creatures</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Combining reptile and cat anatomy</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Use wire form anatomy structures to create the basic shape.</li>

<li>Incorporate lizard features, such as a flat body on the ground, with cat features, like a regal, upright posture.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Adding unique elements</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Example: Create a crown of spikes starting at the eye bridge and wrapping around the head of a lizard creature.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Drawing inspiration from personal preferences</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Pull elements that stand out to you from various creatures, such as frail, spindly legs and big eyes for dragons.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Developing a Personal Art Style</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Accumulating style over time</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Pull bits and pieces from the real world and artists you admire.</li>

<li>Your style will develop naturally as you combine these elements.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Focusing on technical skills</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Don't feel pressured to have a style right away.</li>

<li>Let your style develop in the background as you focus on learning technical skills.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Experimenting with Art Materials and Techniques</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Mixing up materials</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Never get too comfortable with your current materials.</li>

<li>Try new materials to discover new drawing preferences and techniques.</li>

<li>Example: Learning charcoal at Watts Atelier to fill in gaps in traditional art skills.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Using overlaps and folds</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Create overlaps, such as the tail overlapping the foot, to bring dimension and realism to sketches.</li>

<li>Pay attention to folds and creases where joints meet to show how the form changes.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Importance of Storytelling in Art</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Breaking down the storytelling process</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Storytelling is a learnable skill set, not an innate trait.</li>

<li>Practice and learn how to come up with creative ideas and stories in your art.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Teaching storytelling on Instagram</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The author breaks down the storytelling process in their Instagram stories every Friday.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>It's Never Too Late to Start</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Example: Author's mother learning graphic design at 40</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>She decided to learn graphic design and become a graphic designer while in community college around the age of 40.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Pursuing art at any age</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>It's never too late to do what you want to do, regardless of your age.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Designing and Drawing Dragon Creatures</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Toad-like, armored dragon</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Round toad shape with an armored body inspired by crocodile skinks.</li>

<li>False armor with patterns that look like armor from a distance.</li>

<li>Gooey parts designed to look potentially dangerous, like axolotl.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Lollipop dragon (child's suggestion)</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Long, skinny neck like a lollipop stick.</li>

<li>Big, round head like a lollipop with a big eye and little nose.</li>

<li>Lollipop-shaped tail.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Proko dragon (inspired by a kangaroo meme)</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Muscular body with a big tail and a pouch.</li>

<li>Baby dragon drawing charcoal in the pouch.</li>

<li>Spikes instead of ears.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Role of Support and Treating Art Seriously</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Parental support making a big difference</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The author's parents supported their pursuit of art, even if they didn't always fully understand it.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Treating art as a job</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Anyone can become a professional artist by treating it like a serious job.</li>

<li>Take your art seriously and put in the necessary work.</li>

</ul>

</li>
