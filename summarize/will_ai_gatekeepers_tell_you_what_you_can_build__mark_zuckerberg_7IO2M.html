<p>As someone deeply involved in the tech industry, I've been thinking a lot about the future of artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential risks and benefits associated with its development and deployment. When I look at the current mobile ecosystem, I see two gatekeeper companies, Apple and Google, that have the power to dictate what developers are allowed to build. This can be problematic both economically, with these companies taking a large cut of revenue, and qualitatively, by restricting certain features. I'm concerned about the potential for a similar situation with AI, where a handful of companies running closed models could control the APIs and dictate what can be built.</p>

<p>To avoid being in that position, we are building our own models. Many developers also don't want those companies telling them what they can build, which is why I'm philosophically pro open source. However, a concentration of AI power in the future has the potential to be as dangerous as it being too widespread. It's probably bad for one institution to have an AI that is way more powerful than everyone else's.</p>

<p>I believe a world where AI is widely deployed and hardened over time, with different systems keeping each other in check, is fundamentally healthier than one where AI is more concentrated. If we developed a totally safe $10 billion model, as long as it's helping us, we would likely open source it. We have a long history of open sourcing low-level infrastructure software, though not our actual products.</p>

<p>Open sourcing can be helpful in multiple ways. If people figure out how to run models more cheaply, it could save us billions over time as we spend heavily on AI infrastructure. It's an interesting question whether the impact of our open source projects like PyTorch, React, and Open Compute has been bigger for the world than even our social media aspects, given how much of the internet runs on these technologies.</p>

<p>However, with almost half the world using our social media services, it's hard to beat that level of impact. As we move forward with AI development, we must carefully consider the balance between open sourcing our models and infrastructure and maintaining a level of control to ensure the technology is used responsibly and ethically.</p>
