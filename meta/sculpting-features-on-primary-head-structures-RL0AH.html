<p>Hi, my name is Michael Hampton. Welcome to the head drawing and construction course.</p>

<p>In this course, you're going to learn a <strong>step-by-step approach</strong> that will guide you through understanding the <strong>proportions of the face</strong>, developing <strong>primary structures</strong> for your skull and jaw, and addressing the features as sculptures set on top of those primary forms.</p>

<p>This is an extremely <strong>perspective-heavy</strong> and <strong>form-heavy</strong> investigation into the development of the head and face. This system is designed to aid you in the <strong>invention of heads</strong>. You can take this approach as something strict to get a consistent result, but you can also plug in your own interests, concerns, and ways of thinking about the head and skull. It can be easily compatible with your personal style.</p>

<p>Following each lesson, there will be assignments that I will explain and give to you. By the end of this course, I want you to have a <strong>consistent workflow</strong> that allows you to set up a head from beginning to end.</p>

<p>This course will help with many things:

- <strong>Invention</strong>: Building a backbone and scaffolding for the way you think about light and shadow.

- <strong>Understanding plane and surface</strong>: Informing your use of value and edge.

- <strong>Character creation</strong>: You can distort and create various heads or characters by pushing and pulling these shapes.</p>
