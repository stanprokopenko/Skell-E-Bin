<h2>Background of the Leak</h2>

<p>This leak is considered one of the most significant in Google's history, sparking widespread discussion and analysis within the SEO community. It includes 14,000 ranking factors and was shared by Heroy Reman on Twitter. Rand Fishkin, a prominent figure in SEO and founder of Moz, wrote an article about the leak. The leak validates many theories that SEO professionals, including myself, have had, which Google previously denied.</p>

<h2>Key Findings from the Leak</h2>

<p><strong>Domain Authority</strong>: Google measures sitewide authority, known as site authority.</p>

<p><strong>Clicks for Rankings</strong>: Click data influences rankings, contrary to Google's public denials.</p>

<p><strong>Hostage Attribute</strong>: New sites are sandboxed, contradicting Google's denial of a sandbox.</p>

<p><strong>Chrome Data</strong>: Google Chrome data is used in the ranking algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>Microservices</strong>: Google's ranking system consists of microservices like Trowler (crawling), Alexandria (indexing), Mustang (ranking), and Super Root (query processing).</p>

<p><strong>Reranking Functions</strong>: Functions like nav boost, quality boost, and real-time boost adjust search engine results pages before users see them.</p>

<p><strong>Panda Update</strong>: Panda uses a scoring modifier based on user behavior and external links, applied at various levels.</p>

<p><strong>Authorship</strong>: Google stores author information, indicating the importance of authorship in ranking.</p>

<p><strong>Demotions</strong>: Various demotions are applied, including anchor mismatch, SERP dissatisfaction, and exact match domains.</p>

<p><strong>Links</strong>: Links remain important, with metrics like source type indicating the value of links.</p>

<p><strong>Originality of Short Content</strong>: Google measures the originality of short content and counts tokens, reinforcing the importance of key content placement.</p>

<p><strong>Helpful Content Update</strong>: The update relates to baby panda and neuros semantic retrieval, affecting user-generated content.</p>

<p><strong>SEO Beliefs</strong>: The leak validates many SEO beliefs, clarifying Google's ranking mechanisms, importance of quality content, user engagement, and strategic link building.</p>

<h2>Implications for SEO</h2>

<p>The leak highlights several contradictions between the leak and Google's public statements, such as the use of clicks in rankings and the existence of a sandbox. It suggests that clickstream data was a key motivation for creating the Chrome browser. Nav Boost, a system mentioned in the leak, uses click data to influence rankings and evaluate site quality. The leak includes information about penalties for exact match domains and the use of Geo-fencing in click data.</p>

<p>Google uses cookie history, logged-in Chrome data, and pattern detection to fight click spam. Nav Boost measures search intent and adjusts rankings based on user behavior during and after the main query. The leak also includes information about politically driven content being reflected in the algorithm.</p>

<h2>Reactions from the SEO Community</h2>

<p>Rand Fishkin received the leak from an anonymous source, who claimed the documents were confirmed as authentic by ex-Google employees. He confirmed details of their work history and mutual acquaintances in the marketing world. Three ex-Googlers responded; one was uncomfortable commenting, and two confirmed the documents looked legitimate. Mike King, a technical SEO expert, provided an initial review and will present more details at Spark Together 2024.</p>

<p>Rand Fishkin has a background in SEO, co-founded Moz, and authored several publications on SEO. His work on Google and SEO has been cited by Congress, the FTC, and major publications. The leak matches other public Google documentation in style and formatting and serves as instructions for Google's search engine team.</p>

<h2>Big Picture Takeaways for Marketers</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Brand matters more than anything else.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (EAT) might not matter as directly as some SEOs think.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Content and links are secondary when user intention and patterns are present.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Classic ranking factors like page rank, anchors, and text matching have been waning in importance, but page titles are still quite important.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Search intent is super important and can help low domain authority sites rank high if they target people's problems directly.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Page titles are crucial for ranking.</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Journalists and authors should not presume that readers know past public comments by Google's representatives were later proven wrong. The work of journalists and writers in the search marketing field carries weight in public opinion, elected officials, and Google employees.</p>
