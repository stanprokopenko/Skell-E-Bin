<p>I'm Andrew Joseph Keith, and today I'll show you how to create a wire hand armature. This tool serves as a handy reference for drawing hands, offering a 3D perspective that can enhance your understanding of hand gestures and anatomy.</p>

<h2>Materials Needed</h2>

<p>To get started, you'll need:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Aluminum wire</strong>: I recommend a soft aluminum wire, about 12 gauge or two millimeters thick. Adjust the wire thickness based on the size of the hand you're aiming to create.</li>

<li><strong>Pliers with wire cutters</strong>: Essential for cutting and manipulating the wire.</li>

<li><strong>Clay</strong>: I use Chavant NSP medium clay, a non-dry modeling clay that stays malleable. However, any cheaper non-dry modeling clay will suffice.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Cut the Wires</h2>

<p>First, cut five lengths of wire to represent the fingers and forearm. For a half-life-size armature, measure about 10 inches or 25 centimeters, roughly from the tip of your fingers to the middle part of your forearm.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Connect the Wires</h2>

<p>Twist the wires together to form the hand's structure:</p>

<ul>

<li>Start by twisting two wires tightly together for about half an inch or a couple of centimeters, then repeat with another two wires.</li>

<li>Connect the ends of the first set with the ends of the second set, repeating this pattern down the forearm for a secure connection.</li>

<li>Wrap the fifth piece of wire (representing the thumb) around the other four, starting at the middle and working up towards the wrist. It's okay if this wire is a bit shorter.</li>

</ul>

<p>Arrange the wires to resemble a hand, with the tallest wire positioned where the middle finger will be.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Measuring the Length of the Fingers</h2>

<p>Use the "sculptor's cheat sheet" technique for accurate finger length:</p>

<ul>

<li>Close one eye and align the wire armature with your hand, adjusting until the wrist and middle finger of both align perfectly.</li>

<li>Bend the wires to match your fingers and thumb, trimming any excess wire as needed.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Add Clay to the Wire Frame</h2>

<p>Now, add clay to build out the hand and forearm:</p>

<ul>

<li>Cover the forearm wires with small sections of clay.</li>

<li>Create a boxy shape for the wrist, wider from side to side.</li>

<li>Add a thin strip of clay along the palm to represent the padded area where the fingers begin.</li>

<li>Sculpt the three basic muscle masses of the palm: the muscle below the pinky, the thenar eminence at the base of the thumb, and a smaller teardrop shape between the thumb and pointer finger.</li>

<li>Use the sculptor's cheat sheet to compare the size of these muscles with your own hand.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Step 5: Adding Knuckles</h2>

<p>To represent the knuckles and phalanges:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use the halves method to locate the knuckles on the middle finger, then adjust for the other fingers following the natural rhythm of their lengths.</li>

<li>Double-check measurements against your hand if unsure.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Adjustments and Pose</h2>

<p>Once the basic forms are in place, you can pose the hand armature. This is particularly useful for drawing studies, allowing you to understand how the hand exists in space from various angles.</p>

<p>Creating your wire hand mannequin can significantly aid your drawing studies, offering a 3D reference for practicing hand gestures and studying anatomy. I encourage you to give this project a try and share your creations with us using the #prokochallenge. Remember, sculpting adds a whole new dimension to drawingâ€”the third dimension. Stay creative and productive, and I hope to see you again soon.</p>
