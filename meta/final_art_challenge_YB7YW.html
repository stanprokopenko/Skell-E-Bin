<h2>Final Assignments Overview</h2>

<p>For our class's final assignments, we're focusing on both applying the skills we've learned and pushing our creativity. These tasks are designed to challenge you, so take them seriously and have fun with what you've learned.</p>

<h2>Detailed Replication Assignment</h2>

<p>Your first task is to choose one out of three provided images to replicate. Here's how to approach it:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Start with a 15-minute sketch</strong>: Focus on making this initial sketch as good as you can within the time limit. Use a timer to keep track.</li>

<li><strong>Dedicate 1-2 hours for detailed work</strong>: After your sketch, spend an hour to two hours adding as much detail as possible. Pay attention to the subtle aspects of the image and try to capture them.</li>

<li><strong>Limit yourself to a maximum of two hours</strong>: While it might be tempting to keep tweaking, try to complete your work within this timeframe.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Imagination and Technique Assignment</h2>

<p>For those of you who enjoyed the imagination bonuses earlier in the course, this assignment is a chance to stretch your creative muscles:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Revisit your imaginative sketch from the first week</strong>: Take the animal mash-up sketch you did and turn it into a detailed, imaginative piece.</li>

<li><strong>Apply everything you've learned</strong>: Remember to incorporate direct light, specular highlights, subsurface scattering, ambient occlusion, color temperature, and color relativity into your work.</li>

<li><strong>Use references if needed</strong>: It's okay to look back at the references you used for lighting and detail inspiration.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Techniques and Concepts to Remember</h3>

<p>In your imaginative piece, make sure to include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Direct light</strong></li>

<li><strong>Specular highlights</strong></li>

<li><strong>Subsurface scattering</strong></li>

<li><strong>Ambient occlusion</strong></li>

<li><strong>Color temperature</strong></li>

<li><strong>Color relativity</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Instructor's Example and Advice</h2>

<p>I want to share my own experience with the imaginative assignment to give you an idea of what's possible and to offer some guidance:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Starting point</strong>: I began with base colors and a rough idea of light coming from one side, adding some atmospheric elements in the background.</li>

<li><strong>Refining the work</strong>: Using blender brushes and gradually smaller brush sizes, I refined the artwork, cleaning up lines and adding details.</li>

<li><strong>Adding a fantasy element</strong>: In the final stages, I introduced a fantasy aspect to my piece, which took about four to five hours of painting.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Instructor's Process</h3>

<p>My process involved patience, attention to detail, and enjoying the creative journey. I put on some music and focused on refining lines, adding new elements, and zooming in for those little details that make a piece come alive.</p>

<p>Remember, I have a lot of experience, so don't be discouraged if your work doesn't look exactly like mine, especially if you're in a beginner's class. The important thing is to try and apply what you've learned. This is your last challenge for this class, and I can't wait to see what you create.</p>
