<p>This week, I'm faced with a decision for my art assignment. I need to choose between <strong>painting a hand with an orange</strong> or <strong>a skull</strong>. There's also the option to be more ambitious and attempt both. Alongside these choices, there's a recommended study titled <strong>"Early Morning" by Alexander Jakub</strong>, though I'm not entirely sure about the pronunciation of Jakub's name. Trying the "Early Morning" study is highly encouraged.</p>

<p><strong>Additional images</strong> have been added to the folder for extra practice if desired. The more I practice painting these subjects, the easier and more natural it will become. I'm wishing myself luck on my painting endeavors and looking forward to seeing my progress next week.</p>
