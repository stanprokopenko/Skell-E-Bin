<p>Achieving biological immortality or significantly extended lifespans through medical advancements would profoundly impact every aspect of the human experience. From life cycles and reproduction to politics, economics, and societal organization, the implications are vast and far-reaching. However, it's important to note that even with extended lifespans, risks such as accidents, violence, rare incurable diseases, and even the heat death of the universe could still limit our longevity.</p>

<h2>Mitochondrial Rejuvenation Therapy: A Promising Breakthrough</h2>

<p>One promising development in the field of longevity research is mitochondrial rejuvenation therapy, which is currently entering clinical trials in Japan. As aging largely stems from mitochondrial decay, rejuvenating the mitochondrial powerhouses in every cell could significantly improve tissue and organ function and healing. If this treatment increases mitochondrial function by 25-50%, it could give a 50-year-old the energy and vigor of a 25-32-year-old.</p>

<p><strong>Access and Affordability</strong></p>

<p>Once available, wealthy individuals will likely engage in medical tourism to access the treatment in countries like Japan, Thailand, or Singapore. If the medication is cheap to mass-produce, it will likely receive breakthrough status and be fast-tracked for approval in the US and Europe. A gold rush will occur as major pharmaceutical companies pour resources into mitochondrial rejuvenation research to gain a competitive edge. The treatment's cost of production is the biggest question, as making it as cheap as aspirin would incentivize widespread subsidized distribution.</p>

<h2>Societal Changes and Population Dynamics in an Immortal Future</h2>

<p>Access to 20+ extra years of youthfulness will slow down society as people feel less rushed to achieve life milestones like having children or writing books. Successive longevity treatments will compound over time, making it crucial to stay alive and healthy for the next decade to reap the benefits.</p>

<p>Overpopulation is not a major concern, as birth rates decline globally with increased women's rights and economic opportunities. In an immortal future, most people may choose not to have children, and those who do will likely have smaller families, stabilizing the population.</p>

<h2>Future Directions in Longevity Research</h2>

<p>The effectiveness and affordability of rejuvenation treatments are key assumptions, but even a 20% effective treatment opens the door to further medical advances in the field. Monoclonal antibodies, mRNA vaccines, and nanoparticles represent promising new domains for longevity research.</p>

<p>Overall, there are reasons for hope and optimism regarding health and longevity in the coming years. As research progresses and treatments become more accessible, we may be on the cusp of a new era in human history, where the limits of our lifespans are pushed further than ever before.</p>
