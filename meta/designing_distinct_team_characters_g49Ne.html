<p>Designing a team of characters is a fascinating process that requires each member to be <strong>distinct yet complementary</strong> to one another. For this exploration, I'll dive into the design process using the <strong>Marvel Defenders team</strong> as a prime example, given my enthusiasm for the subject.</p>

<h2>Establishing Shape Language and Physical Characteristics</h2>

<p>The journey begins with <strong>rough sketches</strong> to carve out unique <strong>shape languages</strong> for each character. It's crucial to ensure that, despite potential similarities in silhouettes or shape languages, each character stands out with their distinct shapes.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Doctor Strange</strong> serves as the <strong>baseline</strong> for height and shape, positioned at a standard 6 feet tall.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Designing Individual Characters</h3>

<p>Each character is crafted with a unique physique that reflects their personality and role within the team:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Silver Surfer</strong>: Designed taller and leaner, embodying the essence of a surfer or swimmer.</li>

<li><strong>Gargoyle</strong>: Portrayed shorter with a hunched back, offering a stark contrast to the others.</li>

<li><strong>Hellcat</strong>: Boasts an athletic build, fit and agile without being overly muscular.</li>

<li><strong>The Hulk</strong>: Stands out significantly larger, with a very distinct shape language.</li>

<li><strong>Valkyrie</strong>: Envisioned with a brawnier female physique, akin to an Amazon or Asgardian.</li>

<li><strong>Submariner (Namor)</strong>: Similar to Doctor Strange but bulkier, drawing inspiration from his portrayal as a Pacific Islander in the movies.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Visualizing and Adjusting the Team Lineup</h2>

<p>Creating a <strong>lineup</strong> of characters is a pivotal step to visualize how they compare and contrast with each other. This not only presents the design direction clearly but also clarifies it for myself as the artist. A well-defined shape language for each character simplifies their placement in various story contexts and assists other artists who might work on the story.</p>

<h3>Starting with the Main Character</h3>

<p>Typically, I begin with a character like <strong>Doctor Strange</strong> as the protagonist, using him as a standard for shape language. The lead character often has a more <strong>relatable and less exaggerated shape</strong> compared to more unique or extreme characters. After establishing the main character, I proceed to design the others, ensuring they look cohesive as a team.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Team Design</h2>

<p>The most challenging part of designing a team lineup is the beginning, especially determining the main character's design. Comparing other characters to the main character aids in scaling and differentiating their designs. This process is akin to arranging action figures, moving characters around until they visually unify as a team. Adding <strong>notes</strong> to the designs helps solidify the reasoning behind each character's appearance. Once the team's design is planned and the characters are visually unified, the final step is to <strong>draw them in action</strong>.</p>
