<p>I'm tackling a project where I'll be drawing Corvus Glaive, a supervillain from the Black Order, also known as Thanos's right-hand man. This artwork is intended for Marvel Snap. I'm excited because I haven't done a villain yet, and it's a great opportunity to show that if you're a good comic artist, you can find jobs adjacent to the comic book industry, like in games and movies.</p>

<h2>Initial Sketching</h2>

<p>For the initial sketching phase, I follow a core structure that includes the chest, abs, and pelvic area. I quickly sketch out the midsection, positioning the head, arms, and legs to establish a rough area of what I'm going to draw. This is done in a Khan style, which is my go-to approach at conventions, allowing me to move faster than usual. I focus on general shapes and areas, thinking more abstractly and less about the details. This approach is more painter-like, where I lay down abstract shapes quickly and then refine them later.</p>

<h2>Inking and Detailing</h2>

<p>Moving on to inking and detailing, I switch gears from sketching to inking, aiming to capture the character's essence with quick, thin, wispy lines, especially since Corvus Glaive is thinner and moves faster than characters like the Hulk. I use different tools for inking based on the context; for con sketches, I use my usual tools, but for comic inking, I opt for better tools to achieve a cleaner look. My goal is to capture the feeling and energy of the character rather than focusing on perfect details.</p>

<h2>Artistic Philosophy and Techniques</h2>

<p>My con sketch style is influenced by my background in fine arts, including painting, airbrushing, and sculpting. This combined with the necessity to work quickly due to tight deadlines has shaped my approach. I treat the tips of my pens like a paintbrush, going straight in with the blacks without outlining the character first. This method is more organic and helps me capture the natural flow of fabric and textures, especially when using brush pens. I also use white ink and acrylic for highlights and final touches, adding magic to the piece while maintaining a rough, sketch-like appearance.</p>

<h2>Reflections on the Comic Industry</h2>

<p>I've observed significant changes in comic production due to advancements in technology. Today, you can create a comic book much faster than in the past, where the process from pencils to inks to letters to colors took more time. While some may prefer the older style, the tools we use today are what's different, allowing for a quicker creation process.</p>

<p>In the final steps of the artwork, I focus on adding atmosphere and magic with white ink, enhancing the art piece with detail and definition. My approach emphasizes speed, energy, and a unique method of capturing the character's essence. This process is great for knocking out pieces quickly, especially when under tight deadlines.</p>
