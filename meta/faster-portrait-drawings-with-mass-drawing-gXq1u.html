<p>Hi, I'm Stephen Bauman, and in this video, I'm going to show you a technique called <strong>mass drawing</strong>. It's one of the fastest ways to get a portrait drawing on your paper and recognizable. It's also the newest addition to my block-in course on Proko.com. In this demo, I'll work fast and rough, sharing insights and techniques that make mass drawing so effective for portraiture.</p>

<p>Mass drawing is incredibly rapid, much like painting. Think of your pencil as a paintbrush the size of your index finger. I'll start with a series of value shapes that roughly represent the shadow below the nose, the shadow of the eye socket on the left-hand side, and maybe up the edge of the temporal line.</p>

<h2>Initial Steps in Mass Drawing</h2>

<p>I'll begin by taking some measurements. For instance, I'll check where the back edge of the cast shadow lines up with the shadow shape in the upper inner corner of the eye socket. Using the edge of my pencil and looking at my source image, I'll make adjustments as needed. </p>

<p>You can choose to do this now or later, but I'll use my stump to punch up the core shadow, using it as an anchor point. This is what I call a <strong>point of truth</strong>.</p>

<h2>Establishing a Point of Truth</h2>

<p>In mass drawing, the point of truth happens inside the drawing. I'll use the eye socket as a unit of measurement. From there, I'll measure the length from the top of the brow ridge down to the shadow on the nose, adjusting as necessary.</p>

<h2>Blocking in Values</h2>

<p>Next, I'll block in the light shape of the head and incorporate a value in the background to give a full view of the light shape. In mass drawing, we deal with the meetings of values, not lines. This approach helps construct believable proportions straight away.</p>

<h2>Triangulation and Measurements</h2>

<p>Triangulation is crucial in mass drawing. I'll use a harder pencil (an F lead) to make precise measurements. Every shape exists in reference to a non-objective grid, aligning horizontally and vertically. For example, the peak of the cheekbone's light shape lines up with something along the contour.</p>

<h2>Refining the Drawing</h2>

<p>I'll place facial features like the eyes and mouth, avoiding outlining and focusing on value shapes. It's important to leave room for darkening shadows later. For instance, I'll darken the cast shadow of the nose by drilling down with my graphite.</p>

<h2>Using Tools Effectively</h2>

<p>The mono zero eraser is indispensable for precision. When erasing, remember to replace the value to avoid bright spots in the shadow. I'll also add structure to the head with hatching, using a slightly harder lead like 2H.</p>

<h2>General Advice for Mass Drawing</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Good Lighting</strong>: Ensure your source image or model setup has a strong dichotomy of shadow and light.</li>

<li><strong>Materials</strong>: Start with a 4B or 6B pencil for strong contrast, which is easy to manipulate with a paper stump.</li>

<li><strong>Practice</strong>: Like any discipline, practice mass drawing multiple times to understand how it fits into your workflow. Aim for at least five or six reps to observe technical progress.</li>

</ul>

<p>Mass drawing is just one of four block-in styles you'll practice in the block-in course. Each style—visual, structural, hybrid, and mass—should be practiced and understood separately. This will help you integrate all techniques into your drawing process, making you a proficient portrait artist.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this lesson, and I look forward to seeing you in the block-in course on Proko.com.</p>
