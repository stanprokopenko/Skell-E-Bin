<p>I've just rolled out a new <strong>gesture drawing mini-course</strong> on Gumroad. For those subscribed to my email list, I'm offering <strong>pre-recorded critique sessions</strong>. This course is designed to help you blend various exercises to craft organic, captivating shapes.</p>

<h2>Philosophy of Intuitive Drawing</h2>

<p>The course draws inspiration from <strong>Tim Gula</strong>, a figurative artist who studied under legends like <strong>Frank Frazetta</strong> and <strong>Riley</strong>. Gula's method focuses on <strong>drawing from intuition</strong> rather than adhering to rigid plans. <strong>Anthony Jones</strong> shares a similar philosophy, advocating for an intuitive approach that fosters creativity and reduces the pressure to conform to specific visual standards. This method of drawing intuitively can be incredibly rewarding, allowing artists to produce work they're truly proud of, especially when venturing beyond familiar subjects or styles.</p>

<h2>Examples of Successful Intuitive Artists</h2>

<p>Artists like <strong>Michelangelo</strong>, <strong>Morgan Weisling</strong>, and <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> exemplify the power of intuition and confidence in art. They don't obsess over technicalities such as perspective or color theory. Instead, they rely on their intuition, which has led to their immense success and recognition in the art world.</p>

<h2>Concept of "Brain Vomiting"</h2>

<p>One exercise highlighted in the course is <strong>"brain vomiting"</strong> on a page. This approach prioritizes genuine artistic expression over technical perfection or the pursuit of social media validation. Whether it's drawing monsters or capturing the essence of Americana like <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong>, expressing your "innermost soul" is what truly matters. It's crucial to take advice with a grain of salt and appreciate the vast spectrum of human expression in art, which spans from commercial to fine art.</p>

<h2>Importance of Foundational Skills</h2>

<p>Despite the emphasis on intuition, understanding the basics of <strong>gesture, structure, perspective, and primitive shapes</strong> is essential. These foundational skills are the building blocks for developing an intuitive grasp of drawing, enabling artists to express themselves more complexly and honestly.</p>

<h2>Encouragement for Personal Experimentation</h2>

<p>I encourage you to experiment with drawing in a manner that feels natural to you. The key is to focus on <strong>personal expression and creativity</strong>. The process of creating without a specific goal or representational target can unveil narratives or themes in your work that might not surface through more methodical planning. Remember, the journey of art is deeply personal and should be a reflection of your unique perspective and creativity.</p>
