<h2>NVIDIA's Robotics Developments</h2>

<p>We've created <strong>Jetson</strong>, a robotics computer we're very proud of. It's 100% CUDA compatible, supporting a vast amount of software. Our efforts are dedicated to serving our developers, ensuring a rich ecosystem compatible with all our offerings. This enables us to bring incredible capabilities to the compact Jetson computer.</p>

<h2>Advancements in Robotics Software</h2>

<h3>Isaac Perceptor SDK</h3>

<p>We're announcing a new advanced SDK named <strong>Isaac Perceptor</strong>. It's designed to give robots perception for easier programming and adaptive navigation from point A to point B without pre-set paths. Isaac Perceptor introduces state-of-the-art vision odometry, 3D reconstruction, and depth perception for enhanced environmental interaction and navigation.</p>

<h3>CUDA-Accelerated Motion Planning</h3>

<p>The most commonly used robot today is the manipulator manufacturing arm, which is pre-programmed. We've made CUDA-accelerated motion planning algorithms that are geometry-aware for these robots.</p>

<h2>Isaac Manipulator</h2>

<p>Our new development, <strong>Isaac Manipulator</strong>, allows for excellent 3D pose estimation and articulation around obstacles, running on NVIDIA computers.</p>

<h2>The Future of Robotics: Humanoid Robots</h2>

<p>We're exploring the next generation of robotics, likely to be humanoid, leveraging our technology and the abundance of imitation training data available due to human-like construction. Humanoid robots are expected to be more useful and productive in our world, designed for human interaction and tasks.</p>

<h2>Project Groot and Jetson Thor</h2>

<h3>Project Groot</h3>

<p>We introduced <strong>Project Groot</strong> as a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robot learning. It's capable of understanding multimodal instructions and executing actions based on past interactions. NVIDIA's technologies enable Groot to learn from human demonstrations, train models in simulation, and deploy them to physical robots, even allowing motion generation from natural language instructions.</p>

<h3>Jetson Thor Robotics Chip</h3>

<p>The new <strong>Jetson Thor robotics chip</strong> is designed to power the next generation of AI-powered robotics, including Project Groot.</p>

<h2>NVIDIA's Vision for Robotics and AI</h2>

<p>Our vision encompasses the intersection of computer graphics, physics, and artificial intelligence, culminating in the development of advanced robotics projects like Project Groot. The future of robotics and AI is highlighted by the introduction of new industrial revolutions, generative AI, new computing paradigms, and the necessity for digital platforms like Omniverse to support the growing ecosystem of robotic systems.</p>

<h2>Beyond GPUs: NVIDIA's Comprehensive Approach</h2>

<p>Our focus extends beyond GPUs to include comprehensive software stacks, networking systems, and innovative system designs, as exemplified by the <strong>Blackwell project</strong>.</p>
