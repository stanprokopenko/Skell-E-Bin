<p>In today's world, we are constantly bombarded with information from the internet, social media, and 24/7 news cycles. While this connectivity has many benefits, it can also exploit our cognitive biases and lead to increased anxiety, anger, and depression. As someone who has struggled with this myself, I want to share some insights and recommendations for how to manage your information diet for better mental health.</p>

<h2>Understanding Our Cognitive Biases</h2>

<p>First, it's important to understand that many of our cognitive biases and intuitive reactions are based on our evolutionary history. For most of human existence, our experiences were <strong>limited to our local environment</strong>. We dealt with gradual, linear changes and threats that were immediate and nearby. Our brains developed shortcuts and heuristics to make rapid decisions for survival.</p>

<p>However, we now live in a world where we are instantly exposed to information and events from across the globe. Our <strong>negativity bias</strong>, which once alerted us to local dangers, now gets triggered by distant tragedies that don't directly impact us. Our <strong>normalcy bias</strong> makes it hard for us to imagine or accept fundamental changes to our environment.</p>

<h2>The Attention Economy</h2>

<p>The algorithms behind social media and news feeds are designed to exploit these biases to capture our attention. They will find and feed our individual vulnerabilities, whether that's rage, anxiety, or FOMO. This is further amplified by the anonymity of the internet, which enables trolling, cyber warfare, and the spread of misinformation.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that <strong>just because something generates a strong emotional reaction, doesn't mean it's true or relevant to your life</strong>. The outrage you feel from a news story or social media post is real, but it may not reflect your objective reality.</p>

<h2>Curating Your Information Diet</h2>

<p>So what can we do about this? Just like how we manage our food intake, we need to be mindful of our information diet. Constantly consuming junk information is like eating junk food - it leads to psychological ill health. </p>

<p>Some recommendations:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Delete social media accounts</strong> or at least mute/block sources of misinformation and outrage. The algorithms will find ways to exploit your vulnerabilities even if you're aware of them.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Ignore mainstream news</strong>, which is often a constant stream of anxiety-inducing, angry content. Seek out alternative, balanced sources.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Use AI tools like perplexity</strong> to get faster, more balanced information on complex topics. They're not perfect but can provide more perspective than a single source.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Spend more time offline in nature</strong>. Disengage from screens and online debates. Aim for structural changes like setting app limits and keeping your phone in grayscale mode.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Ultimately, no one is forcing you to be plugged in constantly. You have the power to curate your information diet and set boundaries with technology. It's not easy in our modern world, but it's essential for maintaining clarity and emotional wellbeing. </p>

<p>I've been on my own journey with this and have found that the more time I spend away from screens, the better I feel. I encourage you to examine your relationship with information and make intentional choices about what media you consume. Your mental health will thank you!</p>
