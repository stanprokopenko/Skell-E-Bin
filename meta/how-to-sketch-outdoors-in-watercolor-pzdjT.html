<p>Painting from life is a powerful practice that allows us to make artistic decisions and create unique works. Unlike a camera, which captures everything indiscriminately, painting from life lets us see, edit, and compose based on what matters to us. This process is what makes our work unique.</p>

<h2>Importance of Painting from Life</h2>

<p>As artists, we have the power to decide what goes into our paintings and what stays out. This decision-making process is crucial and is best learned by painting from life. When we're out there, we're learning to see, edit, and compose. This practice helps us develop a unique style and perspective.</p>

<h2>Composition and Design</h2>

<p>Creating a compelling composition often involves moving elements around. For instance, we might move a tree closer to a building to create interesting shadows. Overlapping objects, like placing a tree in front of a building, can add depth and interest to our work. Abstract elements can also be used to highlight other parts of the painting, such as using a building to frame another element.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Depth and Interest</h2>

<p>Mixing colors like ultramarine and viridian can add depth to shadows. Hiding parts of objects behind others can create a sense of depth. Adjusting colors on the fly, such as using a dark color in windows instead of wasting it, is part of the process.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Painting Outdoors</h2>

<p>Painting outdoors requires us to work quickly and adapt to the environment. Here are some practical tips:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Using black electrical tape</strong>: Reduce its adhesion by sticking it to your clothes first.</li>

<li><strong>Planning for light and dark contrasts</strong>: In watercolor, you can only go darker, so plan accordingly.</li>

<li><strong>Wet-into-wet technique</strong>: This unique watercolor technique should be utilized for creating depth and mixing greens for trees.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Color and Light</h2>

<p>Mixing greens and adding shadows while the paint is wet can create depth. Use cool darks for less important elements and warm darks to highlight important features. Introducing new colors late in the process should be done carefully to maintain harmony.</p>

<h2>Details and Corrections</h2>

<p>White gouache can be used to add details or correct areas but shouldn't be relied on to fix major issues. Small details like street signs and awnings can be added with white gouache. Mistakes can be fixed by tamping down wet paint with a finger.</p>

<h2>Perspective and Simplification</h2>

<p>Consider perspective when drawing elements like cars. Parking lines and other elements can help define the perspective grid. Simplify a scene by focusing on the main subject and not getting distracted by peripheral details.</p>

<h2>Studies and Final Touches</h2>

<p>Quick studies are essential for learning and inform final illustrations. They focus on capturing color and light rather than perfect drawing. Knowing when to stop is crucial; fiddling with small details indicates it's time to finish.</p>

<h2>Connection to the Scene</h2>

<p>Painting from life presents unique challenges that improve our artistic skills. It creates a deeper connection to the scene, allowing for vivid memories. Establish the main structure of the painting first, and add final touches and small details later.</p>

<p>By embracing these techniques and tips, we can create more compelling and unique works of art. Painting from life not only enhances our skills but also deepens our connection to the world around us.</p>
