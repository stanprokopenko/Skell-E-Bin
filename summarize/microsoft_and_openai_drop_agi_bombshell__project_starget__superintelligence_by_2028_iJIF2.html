<p>Microsoft and OpenAI are plotting to build a massive $100 billion supercomputer called "Stargate" to power the next generation of artificial intelligence systems. This ambitious project aims to create the computational infrastructure necessary to potentially achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the next decade.</p>

<h2>The Scale of Stargate</h2>

<p>The Stargate supercomputer would be an unprecedented undertaking, requiring:</p>

<ul>

<li>Millions of specialized server chips</li>

<li>An estimated cost of up to $100 billion</li>

<li>100 times more computing power than today's largest data centers</li>

</ul>

<p>Microsoft's willingness to invest such a staggering sum suggests they have seen compelling evidence of OpenAI's progress towards AGI.</p>

<h2>Project Timeline and Phases</h2>

<p>The Stargate project is planned to unfold over the next 6 years, with a target completion date between 2028 and 2030. Microsoft and OpenAI are currently in the middle of phase 3 of a 5-phase plan:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> A smaller supercomputer aiming to launch around 2026</li>

<li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> The full Stargate supercomputer to be completed by 2028-2030</li>

</ul>

<p>These key dates align with many expert predictions for when we might see the emergence of AGI.</p>

<h2>Powering the Beast</h2>

<p>One of the biggest challenges facing the Stargate project is the enormous energy requirements:</p>

<ul>

<li>The supercomputer would need several gigawatts of power, equivalent to multiple large data centers</li>

<li>Acquiring sufficient energy is a major hurdle that needs to be overcome</li>

</ul>

<p>To address this, Microsoft is exploring next-generation energy sources:</p>

<ul>

<li>Investing in nuclear fusion research, betting on breakthroughs despite long expert timelines</li>

<li>Competing with Amazon for access to nuclear power to support future data centers</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Race for AI Dominance</h2>

<p>The Stargate project is unfolding against the backdrop of intense competition among tech giants for AI supremacy:</p>

<ul>

<li>AI server chips are a significant cost factor in building AI-focused data centers</li>

<li>Nvidia currently dominates the AI chip market, acting as a "kingmaker"</li>

<li>Microsoft, Amazon, and others are vying for access to energy sources to power their AI ambitions</li>

</ul>

<h2>OpenAI's Secret Weapons</h2>

<p>There are indications that OpenAI may have even more advanced AI capabilities internally that they are not yet ready to reveal:</p>

<ul>

<li>A state-of-the-art voice engine that can mimic anyone's voice in any language</li>

<li>The Qstar model, which can reason about novel math problems and potentially be used for self-improving AI</li>

</ul>

<p>Sam Altman's statements also suggest OpenAI has witnessed AI capabilities far beyond what is publicly available. The sheer scale of Microsoft's planned investment in Stargate is seen as further evidence that AGI may be closer than many realize.</p>

<p>The Stargate project represents a pivotal moment in the race towards Artificial General Intelligence. As Microsoft and OpenAI embark on this audacious endeavor, the world watches with a mix of excitement and trepidation, wondering if we are indeed on the cusp of a technological revolution that will change the course of human history.</p>
