<p>When drawing torsos, focus on the <strong>shoulders, rib cage, and hips</strong>. Visualize the torso as a <strong>wide, tall box</strong> that you can turn, twist, and lean. This approach helps simplify the complex structure of the torso and makes it easier to understand and draw.</p>

<h2>Level One: Drawing from Imagination</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Draw Multiple Pages of Torsos</strong>: Start by drawing several pages of torsos from your imagination.</li>

<li><strong>Start with the Shoulder Plane</strong>: Begin each drawing with the shoulder plane, similar to gestural perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Visualize Hip Movement</strong>: Imagine how the hips will move as the box comes down.</li>

<li><strong>Use Cross-Contour Lines</strong>: Divide the box into sections with cross-contour lines to help visualize deformation.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust Box Proportions</strong>: Modify the box's proportions based on the body type (e.g., husky build vs. tall skinny person).</li>

<li><strong>Experiment with Positions and Deformations</strong>: Try different positions and deformations of the box.</li>

<li><strong>Practice Twisting the Box</strong>: Twist the box to see different planes and angles.</li>

<li><strong>Make Intuitive Adjustments</strong>: Adjust the box intuitively without relying on vanishing points.</li>

<li><strong>Fill Several Pages</strong>: Draw at least 20 boxes to get comfortable with the process.</li>

<li><strong>Seek Critique</strong>: Post confusing drawings for critique and try different approaches to resolve issues.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Level Two: Drawing from Photos</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Start with the Shoulder Plane</strong>: Begin by drawing the shoulder plane from the photo.</li>

<li><strong>Imagine the Box</strong>: Visualize the torso as a box.</li>

<li><strong>Pay Attention to Angles and Curves</strong>: Focus on the angles and curves in the photos, avoiding distractions from clothing.</li>

<li><strong>Use Gestural Rhythm Lines</strong>: Sketch gestural rhythm lines to find the action in the pose.</li>

<li><strong>Decide on Visible Planes and Center Lines</strong>: Determine the visible planes and center lines based on the photo's perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Bloat or Taper the Box</strong>: Add realism by bloating or tapering the box, especially around the rib cage.</li>

<li><strong>Exaggerate Poses</strong>: Push the differences from a neutral pose to exaggerate the poses.</li>

<li><strong>Compare to a Baseline</strong>: Compare the pose to a baseline and push the differences further.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Over-Exaggeration</strong>: Be careful not to over-exaggerate to prevent breaking the form.</li>

<li><strong>Exaggerate Relationships</strong>: Focus on exaggerating the relationships between different parts of the box.</li>

<li><strong>Interpret Exaggerations</strong>: Practice interpreting exaggerations in multiple ways, focusing on twisting and crunching.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Advanced Practice: Exaggeration (Level 2.5)</h2>

<p>For further improvement, practice exaggeration as a more advanced level. Focus on <strong>twisting and crunching</strong> the box to see how far you can push the forms while maintaining a believable structure.</p>
