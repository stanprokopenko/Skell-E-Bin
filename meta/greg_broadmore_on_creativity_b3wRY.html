<p>I had the opportunity to visit Greg Broadmore at WETA Workshop in Wellington, New Zealand. Greg is renowned for his concept design work on films like District 9, Avatar, and King Kong. During my visit, I observed Greg working on a page for an upcoming graphic novel he's both written and illustrated.</p>

<h2>Creative Process and Flow State</h2>

<p>Greg and I discussed the <strong>importance of reaching a flow state</strong> in illustration, where intuition takes precedence over rational thought. This state is not only about presenting ideas from the imagination but also about the pleasure derived from being in the zone. However, Greg pointed out a <strong>conflict</strong> between the need to structure a story for his graphic novel and his desire to draw intuitively. To overcome creative blocks and facilitate entry into this flow state, Greg sometimes reduces his inhibitions with a beer or two.</p>

<h2>Planning vs. Intuition</h2>

<p>Despite <strong>planning his stories in advance</strong> and visualizing each panel, Greg acknowledges that the final drawings often don't match his initial vision. This discrepancy highlights the balance between planning and allowing for intuitive deviations in the creative process.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Self-Doubt</h2>

<p>Greg believes that the <strong>fear of shame</strong> from others viewing one's work is the only real risk in creating art, which he considers a "silly risk." He advises artists to <strong>start creating without worrying about limitations</strong> and emphasizes that comparison, especially on platforms like Instagram, can be detrimental to creativity.</p>

<h2>The Personal Nature of Art</h2>

<p>For Greg, art making is a <strong>personal endeavor</strong>, akin to diary entries, rather than something done for commercial success. He references J.R.R. Tolkien's work on "The Lord of the Rings" as an example of creating art for personal reasons. Greg criticizes the tendency to replicate past successes in art and media, arguing that it leads to diminishing returns and lacks originality.</p>

<h2>The Emotional Journey of Creating Art</h2>

<p>Greg describes the creative process as sometimes feeling magical, as if the art created wasn't entirely by the artist's hand. He acknowledges that the <strong>fear of not being good enough</strong> is a common barrier for artists and students. The emotional journey involves significant existential doubt and questioning one's abilities, which is a common experience among artists.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>

<p>Greg encourages aspiring artists to <strong>simply start their projects</strong> without making excuses. He emphasizes the importance of finding one's own truth in art, a lifelong pursuit that goes beyond technical skills. Understanding and engaging with the universe is a continuous process.</p>

<h2>The Role of Music in Creativity</h2>

<p>Greg draws a parallel between music and drawing in the creative process. While music provides immediate emotional feedback, drawing is a more prolonged endeavor. Both, however, are interconnected in fostering creativity.</p>

<h2>Navigating Doubt and Uncertainty</h2>

<p>Formal training can sometimes act as a distraction from facing challenges directly. Greg admires and applies the punk music ethos to art, emphasizing <strong>confidence and creativity over perfection</strong>. The "number eight wire" philosophy, representing resourcefulness and high standards, is essential for solving problems and achieving success in creative projects.</p>

<h2>The Subjective Nature of Art</h2>

<p>The fluctuating perception of one's own artwork and the varying reactions from others illustrate the subjective nature of art. Greg stresses the importance of pursuing art for the love of it, rather than solely as a career. Making oneself available for inspiration and maintaining a strong work ethic are crucial for creative success.</p>

<h2>Coping with Artistic Success and Failure</h2>

<p>Coping with the highs and lows of artistic success and failure requires a balance between humility and confidence. The value of creating art lies in personal fulfillment and the effort put into the work. Sharing art with others serves as a means of sustenance and a way to inspire and engage in healthy competition.</p>

<p>In conclusion, despite a general disengagement from online platforms, Greg mentions his social media presence as a means of sharing his work. This highlights the importance of making art accessible while navigating the personal and emotional journey of creativity.</p>
