<h2>Composition Techniques</h2>

<p>When drawing for personal enjoyment, I emphasize starting with a <strong>composition as a gesture</strong>. It's crucial to frame the figure within a subdivided frame to <strong>avoid placing the figure directly on the axes</strong>. This technique of beginning with a frame, subdividing it into halves and diagonals, guides the composition effectively.</p>

<p>My favorite teacher, John Watkiss, taught me to compose based on the <strong>golden mean</strong> and an <strong>active asymmetry</strong> of negative and positive space, focusing on the interplay of shape and design. To practice creating asymmetrical compositions, I shift the figure toward one side of the frame, aiming to bring it close to the center without directly placing it on top.</p>

<p>A useful exercise for understanding composition is the <strong>"fly in the room" exercise</strong>, where you create nine composition sketches from different perspectives around a reference image. This exercise helps in building out the entire frame, considering the dynamic interest created by the positioning of limbs and the balance of positive and negative shapes.</p>

<p>I also emphasize the quality of shape I'm leaving, which connects to my <strong>aesthetic and shape language</strong>, analyzing artists in history for these qualities. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of composition through the lens of historical artist analysis.</p>

<h2>Drawing Approach and Anatomy</h2>

<p>When rendering or working for myself, I sometimes use a <strong>part-to-part gesture method</strong>, contrasting with a holistic <strong>global gesture approach</strong>. This method focuses more clearly on shape, involving identifying the part, its gesture, and the perspective of that part, aiming to create perspective with value for shading.</p>

<p>I consider the anatomy of the figure, using <strong>simplified shapes</strong> like Bs and Ss for legs, depending on their orientation, to quickly lay in the figure. This approach emphasizes shape, beneficial for character artists thinking about body types and designing the figure within the frame.</p>

<p>I connect limbs through the scapula and focus on creating <strong>S or triangle shapes</strong> for arms, paying attention to negative spaces and the relationship to the frame. When adding <strong>secondary lines or contours</strong>, I work on top of the initial shapes, using subtle overlaps and ramps to suggest muscle groups without needing to detail every anatomy chart.</p>

<p>I approach hair by considering it as a series of wrapping lines, aiming to make organic shapes feel blocky and related to form. Most of the work in defining the figure comes from lighting, so I ensure I'm confident about the form before moving on to avoid backtracking or solving form issues with edge.</p>

<p>I gesture in hands and use anatomy knowledge without needing to diagram it, applying the knowledge instead of demonstrating it. I vary contours to show muscle groups and anatomy, aiming for asymmetry and a balance of shapes to create a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing figure.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adductor Sartorius</strong> is located between the hamstrings and the calf, where the gastrocnemius muscle is. Understanding the anatomy helps in creating a sense of movement and form in drawing, especially in the lower leg area.</p>

<h2>Lighting and Value</h2>

<p><strong>Lighting</strong> plays a crucial role in defining form and geometry in drawing. It's essential to consider the <strong>direction of the light source</strong> and its effects on the subject. The light source in my drawing seems to be coming from up to my right but slightly behind me. This consideration helps in creating realistic shadows and highlights on different body parts.</p>

<p>When lighting different body parts, it's important to consider their shapes and how they affect shadow and form. For instance, women tend to have more subcutaneous fat, making muscles like the triceps softer and less defined. Different parts of the body, like the deltoid, triceps, and elbow, have different shapes (sphere, cylinder, box) affecting shadow and form. Lighting the back of the leg involves considering the hamstring as a long thin ball and the calf as an egg, with the puppet teal surface being the fat on top of the gastrocnemius. The Achilles tendon is treated as a sharp, box-like form in terms of edge definition.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow design</strong> on the floor helps establish the relationship of light to the environment. Light and shadow patterning involves considering the impact of one leg casting a shadow on the other and how it affects surrounding areas. Hair texture and light are handled differently, focusing on half tones where texture and color are most apparent.</p>

<p>It's important to <strong>avoid outlining in value rendering</strong>; instead, focus on creating edges and atmospheric effects. Reflected light should not be as dark as the darkest areas to maintain the effect of light dissipation. Creating a focal point involves choosing to develop either the lights or the darks more fully, not both. The local value of an object, like skin or hair, is its inherent value minus the light source. Adjusting values and shadows can help communicate the light's dissipation and enhance the drawing's depth. Texture in hair is best represented in half tones, aiming for a balance between realism and abstraction.</p>

<h2>Shape and Tone Separation</h2>

<p><strong>Creating a focal point</strong> in your drawing involves a strategic choice: you can choose to develop either the <strong>lights or the darks</strong> more fully, but not both. This decision is crucial for directing the viewer's attention to the intended area of the composition.</p>

<p>To enhance the depth and communicate the <strong>dissipation of light</strong> across the form, adjusting <strong>values and shadows</strong> is essential. This adjustment helps in creating a more realistic and three-dimensional appearance in your drawing.</p>

<p><strong>Shape welding</strong> is a technique that involves creating a cohesive composition by merging individual shapes. Each shape, while indicating important information on its own, contributes to the overall composition, ensuring that the drawing feels unified and balanced.</p>

<p>The process of creating a successful drawing involves an <strong>iterative process of adjusting values and shapes</strong>. This means going back and forth between different parts of the drawing, making adjustments as needed to maintain consistency in light and shadow patterns, and ensuring that the overall composition works together harmoniously.</p>

<h2>Practical Drawing Tips</h2>

<p><strong>Editing what is seen</strong> is crucial to manage viewer focus. It's important not to draw everything but to choose what to include carefully. This helps in directing the viewer's attention to the intended focal points of the drawing.</p>

<p>To <strong>integrate the figure with the background</strong>, softening edges can be effective. This approach moves towards a painting approach, where edges become more atmospheric, de-emphasizing certain areas and allowing the figure to blend more seamlessly with the background.</p>

<p><strong>Simplifying shapes</strong> is key to avoid unnecessary detail, especially in areas like the hair. This prevents distraction from the focal points and maintains the viewer's focus on the intended areas of interest.</p>

<p>Maintaining a <strong>consistent light and shadow pattern</strong> is essential for clarity in your drawing. Adjusting values and shapes to ensure this consistency avoids confusion between light and shadow areas. The use of hatching for texture and the importance of maintaining form and volume while creating edges are also important considerations.</p>

<p>The challenge of keeping the value scheme consistent, especially when adding light to shadowed areas, requires careful attention. It's important not to create too bright values in areas meant to be de-emphasized according to the established value scheme.</p>

<p>Adjusting edges and values to avoid outlines that can make the drawing look flat or graphic is crucial. This involves a careful balance of light and shadow, as well as a thoughtful approach to edge definition.</p>

<p>Finally, it's important not to get stuck in one area of the drawing. Moving to different parts of the drawing helps maintain perspective and ensures that all elements work together cohesively.</p>

<h2>Personal Insights and Teaching Materials</h2>

<p>I've shared personal anecdotes about my time spent at the Art Center and studying with specific instructors, like John Watkiss. These experiences highlighted the <strong>importance of mentorship</strong> and learning from experienced artists. Having a mentor or learning from someone who has a wealth of experience can significantly impact your growth as an artist.</p>

<p>I've been asked if I can provide the <strong>instructional materials</strong> I created previously. These materials are intended for associates, whom I assist. There's a plan to combine these materials at Kinko's. This shows my commitment to not only improving my own skills but also helping others in their artistic journey by providing them with resources and guidance.</p>
