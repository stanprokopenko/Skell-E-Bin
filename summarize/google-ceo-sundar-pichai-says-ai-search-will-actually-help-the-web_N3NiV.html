<p>I recently had the opportunity to interview Sundar Pichai, the CEO of both Alphabet and Google. We discussed a range of topics, including AI, Search, and the future of the web. This conversation delved into the impact of AI on language and intelligence, the evolution of Google's Search, and the broader implications for content creators and the web ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Language and Intelligence in AI</h2>

<p>I started by asking Sundar if he thinks language is the same as intelligence. He admitted it wasn't an easy question and noted that while language encodes a lot of intelligence, there's more to human intelligence than just language. He emphasized that large language models (LLMs) have shown significant success, indicating that language is more powerful than many initially thought.</p>

<h2>Google's Approach to AI and Multimodal Models</h2>

<p>Sundar introduced Gemini, a multimodal AI model trained with audio, video, text, images, and code. He explained that while we are beginning to see glimpses of its capabilities, the full potential hasn't been realized in products yet. The goal is to make AI more multimodal, which will encapsulate more than just text-based information.</p>

<h2>The Impact of AI on Search</h2>

<p>We then shifted to discussing Search, particularly the introduction of AI previews. Google announced the rollout of the Search Generative Experience to everyone in the United States. This has led to mixed reactions, especially from content creators and publishers. Some view it as a significant change that could impact their traffic negatively.</p>

<h2>Concerns from Content Creators and Publishers</h2>

<p>Content creators and publishers have expressed concerns about traffic loss due to AI previews. For instance, the CEO of the News Media Alliance described it as potentially catastrophic. Smaller websites, like "HouseFresh" and "Retro Dodo," have reported significant drops in Google traffic, raising questions about the future of independent content creators.</p>

<h2>Google's Response to Content Creator Concerns</h2>

<p>Sundar acknowledged these concerns but remained optimistic. He pointed out that historically, transitions like the shift from desktop to mobile have led to similar fears, but high-quality content has always found its audience. He emphasized that Google's approach aims to support the ecosystem by driving traffic to valuable content.</p>

<h2>The Future of Search and AI</h2>

<p>We discussed the evolution of Search from the traditional 10 blue links to AI Overviews. Sundar explained that user intent and context play crucial roles in determining Search results. He believes that AI can enhance user experiences by providing more context and helping users explore topics more deeply.</p>

<h2>Broader Implications of AI on the Web and Content Creation</h2>

<p>One of the challenges with AI is distinguishing high-quality content from low-quality, AI-generated content. Sundar acknowledged this issue and stressed the importance of human-created experiences and authenticity. He believes that AI has the potential to make the web more multimodal and interactive, but it must be used responsibly.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Sundar Pichai envisions a future where the web is richer, more interactive, and more multimodal. He emphasized the importance of aligning incentives to support originality and creativity. Google's role in shaping web development and content creation will be crucial in navigating this transformative period.</p>
