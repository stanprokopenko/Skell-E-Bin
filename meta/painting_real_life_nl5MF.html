<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>You're embarking on an art project that will challenge and enhance your understanding of lighting and material properties through painting. The <strong>objective</strong> is to create <strong>at least three paintings of objects</strong>. However, if you're feeling ambitious, you're more than welcome to exceed this minimum requirement. This project is not just about painting; it's about observing, understanding, and creatively capturing the essence of the objects you choose.</p>

<h2>Selecting and Photographing Items</h2>

<p>Your first task is to <strong>find 10 items</strong> around your home, city, or wherever you reside. These items will serve as the subjects of your paintings. To capture these items, use your phone or any available device to take photographs. This is where your creativity begins to play a role. Be imaginative in your selection process, choosing items that spark your interest or challenge your artistic skills.</p>

<h3>Lighting and Material Properties</h3>

<p>While photographing your chosen items, pay special attention to their <strong>lighting and material properties</strong>. Specifically, look for:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Specular reflections</strong>: These are the bright spots of light that appear on shiny surfaces.</li>

<li><strong>Ambient occlusion</strong>: This refers to areas where light is obstructed, creating shadows that help define the form of the object.</li>

<li><strong>Subsurface scattering</strong>: This effect occurs when light penetrates a translucent material, scattering within it before exiting, often giving the material a soft, glowing appearance.</li>

</ul>

<p>It's crucial to <strong>identify and point out these details</strong> in your photos. Understanding these properties in real-life scenarios will significantly enhance your ability to replicate them in your paintings.</p>

<h2>Observations and Discussions</h2>

<p>Be prepared to <strong>discuss your observations</strong> and point out the details you've noticed in your photos. This exercise is designed not just to improve your painting skills but also to deepen your ability to observe and understand how light interacts with different materials. The instructor looks forward to engaging in discussions with you about your observations and creations, offering insights and feedback that will further your artistic development.</p>

<h2>Encouragement for Creativity</h2>

<p>Throughout this week, you are encouraged to let your creativity flow freely. Whether in the selection of items, the capturing of their images, or the painting process itself, your creativity is a valuable asset. This project is an opportunity to explore, experiment, and express yourself artistically. The instructor is excited to see how you interpret and represent the lighting and material properties of your chosen objects in your paintings.</p>
