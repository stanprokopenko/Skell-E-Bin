<h2>Establishing the Basic Composition</h2>

<p>We start with a simple design pattern for the panel:</p>

<ul>

<li>Arrange figures in a compositional shape</li>

<li>Outline figures with a dark lighting pattern that opens up to draw the eye to the middle</li>

<li>Include foreground elements to frame the panel</li>

</ul>

<h2>Adding Line Weights</h2>

<p>Begin by shadowing underneath objects to add depth:</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with easy areas, such as underneath figures and objects</li>

<li>Press hard for line weights, but be careful not to overdo it</li>

<li>Use line weights to clean up details without focusing on the figures themselves</li>

</ul>

<h3>Foreground and Background Line Weights</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use <strong>thicker lines for foreground elements</strong> and <strong>thinner lines for background elements</strong><ul>

<li>Be careful not to inadvertently use thick lines on background elements, as it can flatten the image</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Finish the foreground first, focusing on the most detailed area</li>

</ul>

<h2>Compositional Shadows</h2>

<p>Add compositional shadows to frame the main figures and direct focus:</p>

<ul>

<li>Shadow out elements on one side to create a localized light and frame the main figures</li>

<li>Use shadows to create turning and dimension on objects</li>

<li>Consider using X's to indicate areas to be darkened, but be mindful of visualizing the final result</li>

</ul>

<p>Add shadows behind main figures to push them up from the wall compositionally.</p>

<h3>Layering Darks and Lights</h3>

<p>Create depth and dimension by layering darks and lights throughout the panel:</p>

<ul>

<li>Alternate between dark and light areas to push elements back and create depth</li>

</ul>

<h2>Refining Details and Shadows</h2>

<ul>

<li>Clean up shadows and make them more crisp</li>

<li>Add texture and detail to main figures, being mindful of the small working space</li>

<li>Be <strong>deliberate and precise</strong> with shadows and line weights, while maintaining a relatively basic compositional framework</li>

<li>Rely on the inker to understand the penciler's intentions, as perfectly clean pencils are difficult to achieve on a schedule</li>

</ul>

<p>By following these steps and being mindful of the composition, line weights, and shadows, we can create a comic book panel with great depth and dimension that effectively guides the viewer's eye to the main focus of the scene.</p>
