<h2>Creative Process</h2>

<p>I've been diving into a new experiment with <strong>CMYK color blobs</strong> and random water shapes. This approach is all about breaking out of my comfort zone and fostering creativity without the pressure of social media expectations. As the water dries, I plan to draw over it, letting the shapes guide my creativity. This process is inspired by the idea of creating a mural with various characters, pushing me to work within the constraints of the shapes formed. It's a crucial exercise for my personal work, helping me explore shapes and ideas I wouldn't normally consider. Inspired by Amano's playful designs, I aim to incorporate a similar sense of playfulness and creativity in my work. I often start drawing with a pen to avoid getting stuck in a perfectionist loop, which I find counterproductive. Viewing random blobs as light and shadow helps me create a fairytale-like vibe without a predefined plan. This approach allows me to relax and draw in a more child-like, exploratory manner. I'm considering how to incorporate interesting hand poses into my characters, using the shapes as a guide. Drawing hands first helps me determine the rest of the arm's positioning and adds a unique aesthetic to my work. I use random color blobs to suggest form and detail, like cross contours on a weapon, enhancing the drawing's depth. If a drawing doesn't work out, I see it as an opportunity to try again, embracing the process rather than focusing solely on the outcome. I believe in the importance of producing work rapidly, accepting failures as part of the learning and creative process. My philosophy is to enjoy the drawing process, likening it to rolling dice and trusting in eventual success despite initial failures. Bad drawing days are normal; persistence and trying again often lead to breakthroughs. I don't consider myself to have mastered drawing just because I work directly with pen; it's more about willingness to keep trying.</p>

<h2>Techniques and Materials</h2>

<p>I use <strong>Kuretake Bimoji pens</strong> for their smooth line quality and compatibility with watercolor and ink without running. I'm exploring drawing a horse, acknowledging the challenge but respecting the skill it represents. The concept of using color blobs and shapes to guide the drawing process allows for unexpected and creative outcomes. I'm considering turning a shape into a Cerberus-like figure, playing with the ink's natural spread for a more dynamic effect. Inspired by Kim Jung Gi's ability to convey volume and have fun with his lines, I aim to incorporate a similar playful approach in my work. I'm thinking about how to integrate characters and details into the drawing, using the color blobs and shapes as a foundation. The process involves adapting to the shapes and colors on the page, allowing them to suggest elements like armor or weapons. Leaving detailed facial expressions for later helps reduce pressure and focus on the overall composition. My current drawing is influenced by recent research for a monster hunter inspired project, reflecting the importance of reference material. I'm considering how the shapes and lines can represent parts of a weapon, using the drawing as a creative exploration that might inform future projects. Sometimes, I revisit certain shapes in my artwork to ensure a cohesive rhythm throughout the piece. I employ both pre-visualization and improvisation in my work, depending on the desired outcome. The emotion I want to evoke in the audience is a guiding factor in my creative process. When focusing on atmosphere over characters, I ensure every addition serves the overarching theme for cohesion. In compositions centered around a character, I use one-point perspective to highlight the character, guiding the viewer's eye. Improvisation in my work often involves balancing the composition to prevent the viewer's eye from getting stuck. Adding pupils to white eyes can change the intensity to a more alive expression. The concept of balance in composition can lead to the addition of elements, like a third character, to enhance the piece. Adapting and hiding mistakes is crucial, especially when working with permanent media. Reusing shapes and motifs can help integrate and hide these mistakes. Darker values in shading can guide the viewer's eye and hint at the lighting scheme, serving both aesthetic and practical purposes. Using shading to hide mistakes should be consistent across the piece to maintain a cohesive style. I consider how to use shapes and lines to highlight certain features without obscuring important elements. Overlapping elements can make the artwork appear more intentional and planned. Leaving characters or elements alone for a while can help in developing their final look or role in the piece. Jumping around different parts of the artwork is a normal part of my process, allowing for flexibility and development. The ability to adapt and revisit elements is essential, especially when dealing with overlapping components. Making something appear cute often involves using big eyes and a somewhat silly appearance. Automatic drawings can inspire more planned out pieces, though time constraints can limit these exploratory sessions. Spontaneous and fun elements in artwork can resonate more with audiences due to their honesty. Incorporating happy accidents and serendipitous elements can lead to the development of unique characters and themes. Developing a narrative or backstory for characters, even in a whimsical or silly context, can add depth to the artwork. The process of creating can involve playing with shapes and colors to find new ways to represent characters or elements. Automatic drawing can lead to the creation of character designs or story elements that might be used in future projects. Adjusting designs to fit a narrative or theme, such as making characters more duck-like to fit a story, is part of the creative process. Collaboration and feedback can influence the development of characters and storylines, adding unexpected twists. The creative process is fluid, allowing for the integration of various elements and themes, from whimsical to dark narratives. Octopus Guy and Scary Cat became allies after an incident where Octopus Guy sliced off one of Scary Cat's arms. The character design process involves using a CMYK color scheme, focusing on cyan, magenta, and yellow to ensure cohesiveness in the artwork. The initial pass of magenta is used to highlight character work and balance the composition with color, without worrying about the exact hue. Mixing the three primary colors (CMYK) in any combination tends to feel cohesive, avoiding clashes that occur with unrelated colors. Light and shadow are strategically placed to balance the image and make certain elements more visible or push others into the background. The use of magenta as a dominant color was decided based on its prevalence in the initial stages of the artwork. The artist uses value to enhance the readability of characters and elements within the piece. Areas intended to be green are carefully managed since magenta does not contribute to green, requiring avoidance of magenta in those areas. Combining all three primary colors in equal amounts generally results in a neutral gray, allowing for flexibility in the use of the dominant color. The artist uses Rohrer and Klinger brand ink and Kuretake Bimoji pens with a medium tip for the artwork, on cheap printer paper. The process of adding yellow to magenta to create orange and other color transformations is described as a fun aspect of discovery in the CMYK approach. Colored inks, as opposed to watercolors, do not allow for corrections once applied, offering less forgiveness but more saturation and depth in colors. The artist experiments with adding blue to the composition, focusing on making the artwork readable by selectively applying color. The improvisational nature of the color application allows for spontaneous decisions that can enhance the overall composition. The artist shares a personal anecdote about being allergic to horses and finding them challenging to draw. As the artwork progresses, adjustments are made to balance the colors, with magenta being reintroduced to counteract an overabundance of blue. The artist emphasizes the importance of planning the central focus of a piece and supporting it with improvised elements that enhance the narrative or visual flow. The final touches involve adding yellow to balance the composition and draw the viewer's eye to specific areas.</p>

<h2>Character and Theme Development</h2>

<p>Incorporating playful and whimsical elements inspired by Amano and Kim Jung Gi, I aim to bring a sense of fun and creativity to my work. Developing characters and narratives through shapes and colors allows for a unique and engaging creative process. Adjusting designs to fit narratives or themes is a crucial part of making the artwork resonate with the intended story. The significance of collaboration and feedback cannot be understated, as it often leads to unexpected twists and enriches the artwork.</p>

<h2>Composition and Improvisation</h2>

<p>Balancing the composition is key to guiding the viewer's eye through the artwork. Using shading and overlapping elements not only enhances the visual appeal but also helps in hiding mistakes. Adapting and integrating mistakes into the artwork is a crucial skill, especially when working with permanent media. The final touches are all about balancing the composition and highlighting focal points to draw attention to specific areas of the piece.</p>

<h2>Reflections on Artistic Journey</h2>

<p>Overcoming challenges and embracing the learning process are integral to my artistic journey. The joy of discovery and experimentation in art keeps the creative process fresh and exciting. Developing a narrative or backstory for characters adds depth and interest to the artwork. The creative process is fluid and constantly evolving, allowing for the integration of various elements and themes, from whimsical to dark narratives.</p>
