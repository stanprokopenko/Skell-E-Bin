<p>I initially fell for Twitter because of its <strong>brevity</strong> and the fun of posting short, dumb statements. It was everything I wanted: fun and stupid. However, as the internet evolved, so did Twitter. It transformed from a place of innocent amusement to a platform dominated by <strong>hot takes, critiques, and tweets with agendas</strong>. It became my go-to for news, keeping up with friends, and contacting YouTube colleagues.</p>

<h2>The Problem with Prolonged Twitter Use</h2>

<p>Over time, Twitter's allure turned into a <strong>sinister force</strong> known as the <strong>Doom scroll</strong>. This phenomenon, where the world's doom and gloom are perpetually online, left me feeling bad after binging on Twitter. The platform shifted from random silliness to attempts to change your mind or push an agenda, accompanied by aggravating replies that highlighted the many horrible people in the world. This constant exposure to strong opinions and negativity led to a <strong>skewed version of the world</strong>, as Twitter users and commenters represent a minority of the population. Despite the negativity, Twitter still had its good, hilarious, and fun aspects, but I decided to engage with it much less. My previous attempts to quit or reduce Twitter usage included a month of no internet, a month of no social media, dumbing down my smartphone for a year, and deleting the Twitter app, but none of these methods had a lasting impact.</p>

<h2>Successful Strategies for Reducing Twitter Use</h2>

<h3>Customizing Access Restrictions</h3>

<p>The successful method involved using <strong>screen time settings</strong> on my Mac and iPhone to limit my access to Twitter, which worked like magic. I learned about content restrictions and how to manage access to web content, focusing on limiting adult websites. To customize access, I went to the settings, clicked the customize button, and then used the plus button to add websites I wanted to block. I decided to block Twitter because it was a major distraction for me. If I decide I want to allow certain sites again, I can add them to an allowed section, humorously referred to as for "filthy animals." The approach to blocking is straightforward: simply block the sites I don't want access to.</p>

<h3>Implementing App Blocks</h3>

<p>On my phone, I used a different strategy by employing an app called <strong>Refocus</strong>. With Refocus, I blocked specific apps like the New York Times, games app, and Twitter app from midnight until 4:00 p.m., which helped manage my time and focus better. I set up a system where Twitter is blocked on all my devices for most of the day, allowing access only during a specific time in the evening.</p>

<h2>Positive Outcomes of Reduced Twitter Use</h2>

<p>Despite the restriction, I found that I didn't even want to use Twitter during the allotted time. Instead, I engaged with the New York Times games app, enjoying games like Spelling Bee, Connections, Wordle, occasionally Sudoku, and Crossword. My lack of interest in Twitter showed me that I don't need to be constantly updated through it, as I found alternative ways to stay informed, such as the Apple News app and various newsletters, which provide a less toxic environment for consuming news. This change resulted in less stress and a more thoughtful consumption of news, where I take the time to form my own opinions without immediately seeking out others' reactions. My online activity now excludes not only Twitter but also Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr, with occasional visits to YouTube or Reddit for specific interests. The overall effect has been a significant reduction in urgency and stress, allowing me to enjoy life more and engage with content more meaningfully.</p>

<h2>Broader Implications and Tools for Online Activity Management</h2>

<p>I speculate that a subconscious readiness to quit Twitter might have facilitated this transition. Despite the focus on Twitter, I recognize that others might have similar habits with different platforms and express hope that my experience could inspire them to consider their own usage. I introduce <strong>NordVPN</strong> as a tool for online security and privacy, explaining its benefits like accessing content not available in one's region and protecting one's data on public Wi-Fi. I conclude by encouraging self-intervention through blocking distracting or unnecessary online activities as a means to improve quality of life.</p>
