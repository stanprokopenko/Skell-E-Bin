<p>Last week, we dived into the basics of painting in black and white, focusing on teaching the fundamentals of painting and color blending. This week, we're taking a step further by introducing new tools in Photoshop to enhance your color blending and painting techniques. I demonstrated painting a red ball, emphasizing the challenge of achieving smooth transitions between colors. However, I expressed my dislike for the Photoshop smudge tool due to its inefficiency and slow performance.</p>

<p>I introduced the Mixer Brush tool in Photoshop as a superior alternative for blending colors. Its complexity and versatility stand out compared to other software. To get the most out of the Mixer Brush tool, here are the settings I recommend:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Clean brush</strong> after every stroke</li>

<li><strong>Unselect the first button</strong> and <strong>select the second</strong></li>

<li>Set <strong>wetness to 100%</strong></li>

<li>Set <strong>load to 1%</strong></li>

<li>Set <strong>mix to 0%</strong></li>

<li>Set <strong>flow to 100%</strong></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>The choice of brush and the direction</strong> of your strokes are crucial for achieving the desired blending effects. I suggest experimenting with different brushes to discover varying textures.</p>

<h2><strong>Painting Complex Images</strong></h2>

<p>I assigned the task of painting three complex images, involving color, refraction, reflections, and subtle details. It's best to start with simpler shapes and gradually move to more complex ones. To assist, I provided a Photoshop file with layers, including the original painting, a white layer, and a line guide. <strong>Locking the line guide layer</strong> is essential to prevent accidental alterations. I also highlighted the utility of layers for organizing different elements of the painting and recommended starting with a non-white background color. The concept of <strong>alpha lock</strong> in Photoshop was introduced for painting within defined boundaries.</p>

<h3><strong>Techniques for Painting Shadows and Details</strong></h3>

<p>For efficiency and organization, paint shadows and details on separate layers. I showed how to use the Mixer Brush tool to blend colors and achieve smooth gradients, stressing the importance of brush direction and flow. Observing and replicating subtle details in the images, such as light reflections and color variations, can significantly enhance realism.</p>

<h2><strong>Comparing Blending Tools Across Software</strong></h2>

<p>I briefly explored the blending tools and alpha lock features in other software like Krita, Clip Studio Paint, Affinity Photo, and Procreate. I noted differences in functionality and ease of use. Specifically, I mentioned a potential focus on painting in Krita in future sessions due to its favorable blending tools and overall functionality as a free software. However, I advised caution when using the blending tool in Affinity Photo due to its tendency to introduce unwanted artifacts and colors. Procreate's blending tool and color picker were praised for their efficient painting on the iPad, thanks to its intuitive design and functionality.</p>

<p>The importance of experimenting with different tools and techniques cannot be overstated. Each artist's style and preferences are unique, and finding what works best for you is key. Whether it's mastering the Mixer Brush tool in Photoshop or exploring the blending capabilities of other software, the journey to enhance your digital painting skills is an exciting one.</p>
