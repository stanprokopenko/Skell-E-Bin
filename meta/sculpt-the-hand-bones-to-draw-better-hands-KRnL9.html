<p>Welcome to this demo on sculpting a study of bones. In this guide, I'll walk you through the process of building a wire armature, preparing materials, and sculpting the bones of the hand. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Preparing the Armature</h2>

<p>First, I built the wire armature by twisting wires together at the wrist. Hopefully, you've made a few of these by now following previous demonstrations. </p>

<p>To make a stand, I used a plywood board and a metal floor flange. The metal floor flange is a one-half inch piece screwed into the baseboard. On top of that, I screwed a six-inch by one-half inch metal pipe. This setup is useful for portraiture and other sculptures. </p>

<p>I buy hose clamps, half-inch metal pipes, and floor flanges in bulk to lower costs. I also use recycled plywood boards from a countertop place and always look for supplies like soft aluminum wire, which is also recycled.</p>

<h2>Sculpting the Radius and Ulna</h2>

<p>I started with the radius bone, which gets wider at the thumb and smaller towards the elbow. The turning motion of the wrist happens at the radius. For additional support for the ulna, I twisted another length of wire around the wrist.</p>

<p>The clay I used is a sculpting wax similar to microcrystalline wax. This wax is sticky, making it good for sticking to the aluminum armature but not great for detailed tool work. The wax color is a purplish, almost skin tone.</p>

<h2>Adding Metacarpals and Carpals</h2>

<p>I added a layer of clay for the metacarpals and carpals. I would have covered the entire armature with a thin layer of clay for better support. I built up the metacarpals and indicated the shape of the carpals. </p>

<p>I considered the length of the metacarpals and the position of the knuckles. For the carpal bones, I focused on the shape from different views.</p>

<h2>Sculpting the Thumb and Phalanges</h2>

<p>Next, I worked on the thumb and phalanges, getting the basic shape right. The bones have a similar structure: wider at the base, tapering towards the top, with rounded condyles. The shape of the bones shows through the fleshy fat pad at the tips of the fingers. This study helps understand the hand's structure.</p>

<h2>Refining the Sculpture</h2>

<p>I worked around the sculpture from every angle to ensure no bones were underdeveloped. I thought about the cross-section of each bone, usually triangular. Sculpting helps solidify information about the hand faster than drawing.</p>

<p>I refined and defined the sculpture using tools but didn't aim for a realistic texture. Adding pieces of clay thoughtfully can be effective without texturing. For a finished skeletal study, consider using polymer clay to bake it in an oven.</p>

<h2>Final Adjustments and Review</h2>

<p>After posting a video on Instagram, I noticed the thumb was too short. I adjusted the thumb by lengthening the first metacarpal. Taking pictures and sharing updates can help spot mistakes. Focus on the shape of the bones at the base, top, and outline from different views.</p>

<p>The final version of the sculpture is shown. In the next lesson, we'll add muscles of the hand onto these bones. Doing the assignments helps build muscle memory and understanding. Post your studies under the assignments tab. Stay creative and productive!</p>
