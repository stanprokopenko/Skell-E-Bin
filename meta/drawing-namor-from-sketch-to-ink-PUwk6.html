<p>I started with a quick sketch of a guy sitting down and refined it. Today, I'll show the inking process, focusing on Namor, one of my favorite characters.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Sketch and Refinement</strong></p>

<p>The initial sketch is about getting the body language right. I adjusted the pose to make it more characteristic of Namor, inspired by Jim Lee's depiction. I experimented with different slouches and camera angles to capture the right feel. Drawing at a smaller scale helps control and see the figure better.</p>

<p><strong>Research and Understanding the Character</strong></p>

<p>Research is crucial when drawing a character you're not familiar with. Understanding the writer's vision for the character is essential. Adding details and world-building elements is part of the process. The goal is to transform a generic figure into a specific character.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing Techniques and Challenges</strong></p>

<p>Drawing the perfect gesture initially can be challenging to replicate at a larger size. Art school can be a bubble; real-world art involves constant learning and financial pressures. There's no end to learning in art; it's a continuous process. I strive to improve with each piece and avoid getting too comfortable in one style. The struggle in art is ongoing, and even experienced artists face challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Tools and Inking Process</strong></p>

<p>Digital tools are essential for cleanup and finishing touches. Inking over someone else's pencils involves enhancing their work, not changing it. Communication between penciler and inker is crucial for consistency. Practicing different styles requires a mindset shift more than hand practice.</p>

<p><strong>Reference and Realism</strong></p>

<p>Using models for reference can be challenging; I often use my kid or myself. Photos can distort reality, so it's important to correct these distortions in your drawings. Tracing can help understand the figure but should be used to learn, not as a crutch. Drawing at different sizes can affect the level of detail and control.</p>

<p><strong>Storytelling in Comics</strong></p>

<p>Reading the script thoroughly helps visualize the story like a movie. Taking time to think about the story and characters can improve the final artwork. Deciding on the focal point of a page helps guide the drawing process. When creating comics, self-publishing can lead to skipping essential storytelling lessons. I learned storytelling from Joe Quesada, Jimmy Palmiani, and Joe Rubinstein. They helped me overcome the fear of the page and transitioning between different styles. Without guidance, you might not understand the storytelling language and structure. Learning storytelling is a gradual process, not something you can quickly absorb from a YouTube channel.</p>

<p><strong>Tools and Techniques</strong></p>

<p>Traditional brushes require control, and switching tools shouldn't make your style look less polished. There's a stigma in art schools about using certain tools, like digital inking versus traditional brushes. Dead lines in digital inking can flatten the work, lacking contour and depth. Keeping the line fluid is crucial, even when using tools contrary to your usual methods. Inking involves knowing where you're going, even if you don't see the final picture immediately. Penciling raises more questions than inking, which focuses on line hierarchy and black areas.</p>

<p><strong>Teamwork and Trust</strong></p>

<p>Trust within the team is essential; if the writer tries to control the artist's work, it can hurt the story. Writers who don't understand comic storytelling or come from novel writing backgrounds may struggle with the abbreviated language of comics. Drawing is a different language from writing, requiring concise visual storytelling. Artists must convey complex emotions and actions in a single picture, unlike the detailed descriptions in novels.</p>

<p><strong>Discipline and Drive</strong></p>

<p>Discipline, stamina, and conviction are essential for artists; drawing every day builds these qualities. Artists must continue creating even if their work is plagiarized or goes unrecognized. The drive to create is intrinsic and cannot be replicated by machines or those without the experience.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Experiences and Character Design</strong></p>

<p>Comics offer an escape into a fantasy world, initially without concern for self-reflection. Personal experiences can subtly ground characters in reality, making them relatable. Realism in character design, like practical clothing, enhances the story's believability. As a woman of color, incorporating cultural practices, like covering hair at night, adds authenticity.</p>

<p><strong>Love for Comics and Characters</strong></p>

<p>My love for Namor and other characters developed despite limited exposure to comics as a child. Discovering comics through a Spider-Man ash can from missionaries was a transformative experience. Reading comics helped me regain confidence in speaking English after returning to America. I enjoy drawing epic battle scenes and seeing evil vanquished, preferring action over introspective scenes. Characters like Namor, who are complex and not entirely wicked, are particularly compelling to me.</p>

<p><strong>Practical Workflow</strong></p>

<p>I can't touch him anymore, so I have to have another page that I'm inking at the same time. This means the current page goes away. By the time the other page gets too wet to touch, I come back to the first one. The first page is dry, so I finish inking it. I turn in the finished page. The other page gets finished afterward. If it's still not enough, I start a third page. Then, they see magic!</p>
