<p>Hi everyone, I'm Mira Murati. Today, I'm excited to talk about three main things. We'll discuss why it's crucial to make our product broadly available, the launch of our new flagship model GPT-4o, and showcase some live demos of its capabilities. Let's dive in!</p>

<h2>Importance of Accessibility</h2>

<p>At OpenAI, we believe it's essential to make advanced AI tools available to everyone. We're always looking for ways to reduce friction so that everyone can use ChatGPT wherever they are. Recently, we made ChatGPT available without the sign-up flow, and today, we're releasing the desktop version to make it even simpler and more natural to use.</p>

<h2>Launch of GPT-4o</h2>

<p>The big news today is the launch of our newest flagship model, GPT-4o. This model brings GPT-4 intelligence to everyone, including our free users. GPT-4o is faster and improves capabilities across text, vision, and audio. This is a significant step forward in making AI interactions more natural and easier to use. We're excited to roll out these features over the next few weeks.</p>

<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>

<p>Along with GPT-4o, we're introducing several new features and improvements:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Desktop Version of ChatGPT</strong>: Now available for easier and more natural use.</li>

<li><strong>Refreshed User Interface</strong>: Designed to make interactions more seamless and intuitive.</li>

<li><strong>Voice Mode Improvements</strong>: Real-time conversational speech, emotion detection, and various voice styles.</li>

<li><strong>Vision Capabilities</strong>: Ability to see and interpret visual content like screenshots, photos, and documents.</li>

<li><strong>Memory Feature</strong>: Provides continuity across all your conversations.</li>

<li><strong>Browsing and Advanced Data Analysis</strong>: Search for real-time information and analyze data with ease.</li>

<li><strong>Support for 50 Different Languages</strong>: Improved quality and speed for a more inclusive experience.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Live Demonstrations</h2>

<h3>Real-Time Conversational Speech</h3>

<p>We demonstrated the real-time conversational speech capabilities of GPT-4o. The model can now handle interruptions, respond in real-time without lag, and detect emotions. For example, it can provide feedback on breathing exercises and tell bedtime stories with varying levels of drama and emotion.</p>

<h3>Vision Capabilities</h3>

<p>We showcased the vision capabilities by solving a math problem. GPT-4o can interpret handwritten text and provide step-by-step guidance. It can also interact with code, generate plots, and analyze visual data.</p>

<h3>Interaction with Code</h3>

<p>We demonstrated how GPT-4o can help with coding tasks. It can understand and describe code, suggest improvements, and even generate plots based on the code provided.</p>

<h3>Real-Time Translation</h3>

<p>GPT-4o can function as a real-time translator. We showed how it can translate English to Italian and vice versa, making it easier to communicate across languages.</p>

<h3>Emotion Detection from Facial Expressions</h3>

<p>We tested GPT-4o's ability to detect emotions from facial expressions. By analyzing a selfie, the model accurately identified emotions like happiness and excitement.</p>

<p>Today, we've introduced GPT-4o and its new features, emphasizing the importance of making advanced AI tools accessible to everyone. This technology feels magical, yet it's designed to be practical and easy to use. We're excited to bring these capabilities to all our users and look forward to updating you on our progress towards the next big thing.</p>

<p>Thank you to the incredible OpenAI team and our partners for making this possible. And thank you all for being a part of this journey with us.</p>
