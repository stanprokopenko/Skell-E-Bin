<p>I'm Ben, and I have a passion for drawing and painting, especially in a stylized manner. In this video, I'll discuss why traditional methods like the Loomis method are fantastic for drawing the head but also how they might have limited my artistic journey. This discussion is particularly focused on stylized, character-driven artwork. I'll also share the techniques I use to draw these stylized heads.</p>

<h2>Traditional Methods and Their Limitations</h2>

<p><strong>Traditional methods</strong> such as the <strong>Loomis method</strong>, the <strong>Riley method</strong>, <strong>Steve Houston's triangle shapes</strong>, and <strong>Michael Hampton's structuring</strong> are well-known and highly recommended for learning how to draw the head. However, I encountered a problem when trying to apply these methods to stylized work. After practicing a method extensively, everything would fall apart when I attempted to create a stylized character. This led to frustration and made me question why my drawings weren't turning out as I hoped.</p>

<p>I realized that rigidly adhering to one method was limiting. This rigid mindset held me back in my artistic journey for a long time.</p>

<h2>Developing a Personalized Approach</h2>

<p>To overcome this limitation, I shifted my approach. I began to dive deep into various drawing methods, picking and choosing elements that resonated with me. This allowed me to build an <strong>"artistic tool belt"</strong> that I could draw from flexibly, depending on the drawing challenge at hand.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Drawing Stylized Heads</h2>

<h3>Starting with Big Shapes</h3>

<p><strong>Big shapes first</strong> is a mantra I keep in mind. This approach informs everything that follows in the drawing process. For example, for a robust character, I focus on big, square, and angular shapes, keeping them simple.</p>

<h3>Adding Dimension and Detail</h3>

<p>To add dimension, I use a leading line from the brow, eye socket, cheekbone, down to the chin. This helps create a 3D form from a 2D shape. I also incorporate Steve Houston's triangle shape method for quick head direction and dimension, especially when combined with the nose and ear placement.</p>

<p>For eye placement, I think about the brow and how the eyes sit on the face. The <strong>"whistle method"</strong> helps abstract the head into a shape that emulates the brow and eye sockets, aiding in correct eye placement.</p>

<p>When adding smaller shapes like the nose, mouth, and eyes, I focus on subdividing the larger shapes while keeping everything simple and thinking in 3D forms.</p>

<h3>Learning from Style References</h3>

<p>I use style references from my favorite artists to solve stylistic problems, mixing and matching elements like eyes, head shapes, and expressions from different artists. This process helps me build my own style.</p>

<h2>Reflections on the Learning Process</h2>

<h3>The Danger of Blind Imitation</h3>

<p>Blindly copying other artists without understanding the rationale behind their techniques can be dangerous. It's important to question and understand the "why" behind drawing decisions. This understanding can transform drawing sessions from a gamble to a more logical process.</p>

<h3>Continuous Learning and Adaptation</h3>

<p>Learning and style development is an ongoing process. My goal is to continuously expand my "tool shed" of drawing techniques and approaches, learning from both new and favorite artists.</p>

<p>Flexibility and personalization are key when drawing stylized heads. By building an artistic tool belt and continuously learning, you can develop a unique style that transcends traditional methods.</p>
