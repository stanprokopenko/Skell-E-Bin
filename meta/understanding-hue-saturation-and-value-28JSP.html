<p>Hi everyone, my name is Mark Obuchi and I'm here to help you get started with using color in your digital paintings. When it comes to talking about color, the most important thing is to make sure we're all using the same vocabulary. There are three main ways to modify a color, so let's go over those and talk about some terminology as we do.</p>

<p>Understanding color is crucial in digital painting. To communicate effectively, we need a common vocabulary. The three main aspects of color we'll focus on are <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>saturation</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Hue</h2>

<p><strong>Hue</strong> is the name of the color, like red, green, blue, or purple. Every digital painting app has a color picker that shows you a color wheel where you can pick different hues for your paintings. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>

<li>Photoshop</li>

<li>Painter</li>

<li>Procreate</li>

</ul>

<p>For now, let's ignore the middle part of these color pickers and just focus on the hue wheel that goes around them. It's always the same progression of hues along the color wheel. Some versions of Photoshop might show a vertical hue strip, but it's the same progression of hues, just unwound into a straight line.</p>

<h2>Primary and Secondary Colors</h2>

<p>You may have heard of the three primary colors: <strong>red, blue, and yellow</strong>. These are considered primary because they can't be created by mixing other colors. Any other color can be created by mixing these three primaries. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>Mixing red and yellow gives you orange.</li>

<li>Mixing red and blue gives you violet or purple.</li>

<li>Mixing yellow and blue gives you green.</li>

</ul>

<p>On the color wheel, the hues tell you this. Orange is between red and yellow, violet is between blue and red, and green is between blue and yellow. These new colors, <strong>violet, orange, and green</strong>, are known as secondary colors.</p>

<h2>Saturation and Its Importance</h2>

<p><strong>Saturation</strong> is the amount of color in a hue, or how vibrant it is. This is where we upgrade our color wheel to show two dimensions of color: hue and saturation. Any hue can have a variety of saturation levels. For example, you can pick a very saturated red or a very desaturated red. Desaturating a color brings it closer to gray.</p>

<h2>The Role of Gray and Neutral Colors</h2>

<p>When you desaturate any hue, you bring it closer to gray. Gray is important because every hue has gray in common, making it a convenient way to travel from one color to another. Desaturated or neutralized colors create a more pleasing visual aesthetic. Neutral colors are close to gray but can have some saturation.</p>

<h2>Understanding Value</h2>

<p><strong>Value</strong> refers to the lightness or darkness of a color. You don't need color to discuss value. A grayscale chart shows tones from white to black and all the tones in between. Value is the most important element of your digital paintings because it determines the light and form of what you see. It's common for aspiring artists to work in grayscale before adding hue and saturation.</p>

<p>Value can be tricky with the color wheel because it doesn't show us value. For example, two different colors might have the same hue but different values. Doing pure value studies can heighten your understanding of form, which will elevate your color work.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications in Digital Painting</h2>

<p>In traditional painting, you mix colors on your palette. In digital painting, it's often not advisable to mix colors this way because digital software doesn't treat colors like real-world pigments. For example, mixing blue and yellow in real paint gives a vibrant green, but digitally, it might lack vibrancy. Instead, you would simply pick the vibrant green.</p>

<p>To summarize, we've covered <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>saturation</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>. Understanding these terms and their roles in color theory is essential for your digital painting journey.</p>
