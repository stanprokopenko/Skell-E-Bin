<p>As an artist, I often find myself wanting to break away from strictly realistic depictions, especially when it comes to drawing the human figure. One way I like to do this is by playing with manipulation and distortion to create more visually interesting and expressive sketches.</p>

<p>Let's take the example of drawing a classic car from the 1920s or 30s. I start with a base sketch to establish the angle and basic forms - the fenders, windshield, roof, wheels, etc. But then, I allow myself to have fun and experiment. I'll manipulate and distort elements like the grill, fenders, and wheels to give the car a more dynamic look. I might curve and twist the bumper, stretch out the windshield, or exaggerate the size and angle of the wheels.</p>

<p>As I refine the sketch, I'll add details and shadow shapes to enhance the sense of movement and energy. The goal is to express action, story, and emotion beyond what you'd see in reality. It's not about stylization for its own sake, but about using creative exploration to capture something more intense and engaging.</p>

<h2>Building a Visual Vocabulary</h2>

<p>To draw expressively, it helps to have a strong visual vocabulary. I develop this through a mix of intentional study and loosely drawing from observation. When I encounter an unfamiliar subject, I take the time to do multiple studies and really absorb the information. But I also allow myself to sketch freely, even if it's something I haven't drawn much before.</p>

<p>The key is to look for archetypes and use my prior knowledge of related subjects. For example, if I'm drawing a snow leopard for the first time, I can apply my understanding of tiger anatomy and proportions as a starting point. Big cats share certain structural relationships, even if the details differ.</p>

<p>So instead of trying to memorize every possible subject, I focus on understanding the basic forms and proportions of broad categories. Then I can adjust and customize those archetypes to fit the specific subject in front of me.</p>

<h2>Light, Shadow, and Speed</h2>

<p>When it comes to light direction and shadow shapes, I often combine realistic lighting with aesthetic design choices. The important thing is to be intentional and consistent in my approach from the very beginning.</p>

<p>As for drawing speed, it mainly comes down to familiarity with the subject matter. The more I've drawn something, the less I have to think about it. I can just react and let my hand flow freely, without second-guessing lines or details. If proportions are significantly off, I may need to start over. But often, I can make adjustments as I go, consolidating areas with shadow or selective detail.</p>

<h2>Tools and Influences</h2>

<p>Over the years, I've transitioned from pencil and ballpoint pen to using felt-tip pens and brush pens. Felt-tips force me to commit to each line, building confidence through repetition. Brush pens took some getting used to, training my sensitivity to touch, speed, and pressure. But I found the best way to learn was to dive in when my curiosity was piqued, rather than waiting for the "perfect" time.</p>

<p>I've been influenced by many artists over the years, some of whom were also major influences on contemporaries like Kim Jung Gi. Being part of a collective like Superani, surrounded by like-minded artists, naturally leads to a lot of cross-pollination of ideas and techniques.</p>

<p>But ultimately, I believe every sketch is a learning opportunity. Whether loose or polished, each drawing is a chance to explore, experiment, and grow. By staying present and open, I can use my sketches to project ideas, express emotions, and tell stories in new and exciting ways. That, to me, is what it means to draw expressively.</p>
