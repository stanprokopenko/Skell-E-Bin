<p>Cross contours are essential for understanding and depicting three-dimensional forms. Practicing them repeatedly will help you get comfortable with the technique. You might overdo it at first, but that's okay. The goal is to integrate cross contours into your drawing process naturally.</p>

<h2>Starting with Simple Shapes</h2>

<p>Begin with the simplest forms: blobs. Visualize how cross contours wrap around these shapes from different angles.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Drawing Blobs</strong>:<ul>

<li>Imagine looking up at a blob and how the contours cover different parts.</li>

<li>Use center lines sparingly to help show compression and wrapping over the front plane.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Advancing to More Complex Forms</h2>

<p>Next, move on to drawing ginger roots. These are essentially blobs that grow other blobs from various angles.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Drawing Ginger Roots</strong>:<ul>

<li>Use real ginger as a reference or invent your own shapes.</li>

<li>Focus on making the blobs look good and dynamic.</li>

<li>Remember the principles of dynamic shapes and how cross contours interact with them.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Using Reference Images</h2>

<p>When drawing from photos, be mindful of surface marks that might mislead you about the form.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Drawing from Photos</strong>:<ul>

<li>Surface marks might not always align with the actual form.</li>

<li>Adjust your cross contours to accurately depict the form coming towards or away from you.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Level 1.5: Adding Complexity</h2>

<p>Once you're comfortable with blobs and ginger roots, start adding complexity by creating characters from blobs.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Creating Characters</strong>:<ul>

<li>Add eyes and expressions to your blobs.</li>

<li>Think about how the shapes twist and turn, and how cross contours can show this.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing Sea Creatures</h2>

<p>Find reference images of sea creatures like fish, seals, or sea lions. Focus on those that are coming towards you to make the cross contours more useful.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Finding Reference Images</strong>:<ul>

<li>Look for images where the creatures are not in extreme side or front views.</li>

<li>Use gesture drawing to capture the movement and then add cross contours to show form.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Level 2: Tackling More Complex Creatures</h2>

<p>Move on to more complex creatures like lobsters and crabs. Break down their forms into simpler shapes and use cross contours to show volume and depth.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Drawing Lobsters and Crabs</strong>:<ul>

<li>Start with simple shapes and gradually add details.</li>

<li>Use cross contours to show how different parts of the form wrap around.</li>

<li>Add small details to enhance the three-dimensionality.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Imagining Different Angles</h2>

<p>Practice rotating forms in your mind and use cross contours to visualize them from different perspectives.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Rotating Forms</strong>:<ul>

<li>Imagine how the form would look from another angle.</li>

<li>Use cross contours to help figure out the shapes and their relationships.</li>

<li>Experiment with various poses and angles to improve your understanding.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The key to mastering cross contour drawing is practice. Be creative and experiment with different forms and perspectives. Remember, the goal is to imagine and depict three-dimensional forms accurately. Have fun with it and keep practicing!</p>
