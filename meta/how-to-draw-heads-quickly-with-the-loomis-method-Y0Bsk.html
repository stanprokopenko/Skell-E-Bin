<p>Hey, guys, welcome to Proko. My name is Stan Prokopenko. It's been six years since I made my first Loomis head drawing video. Since then, I've gotten a lot of questions regarding the Loomis method. So, I think it's a good time to take a second look at it through a bunch of quick sketches and give you guys some tips on using the Loomis method. This should help you get better head drawings quickly.</p>

<p>This is going to be a three-part video series:

1. <strong>Review the basics.</strong>

2. <strong>Adapt the Loomis head to heads of all shapes and proportions.</strong>

3. <strong>Show a more intuitive approach using the Loomis method more loosely.</strong></p>

<h2>Basics of the Loomis Method</h2>

<p>The Loomis method starts with a <strong>cranial mass as a sphere</strong>. Then, we attach a jaw to it with a <strong>triangular boxy shape</strong>. The side of our head is kind of flat, so we chop off the side of the sphere to create a flat plane.</p>

<p>In a neutral pose, the middle of the head is where the <strong>eyebrows</strong> are. This line wraps around the head like a rubber band. From the bottom of this oval, we bring another parallel line across to mark the <strong>nose</strong>. Dropping down from there gives us the <strong>chin</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing a Basic Loomis Head</h2>

<p>From here, we attach the jaw from the brow side plane down to the chin. The jaw starts about halfway down the side plane. This can vary on different people, but for now, we're drawing an average person.</p>

<p>Next, we divide the jaw into front and side planes. The side of the chin starts at the corner of the forehead and comes down. You'll typically see core shadows or highlights along these planes, except in the deep eye socket.</p>

<p>Here's a quick sketch of a Loomis head. For a quick sketch, I wouldn't go further than this. Maybe I'll add a center line. Usually, I go a bit further with features and more construction lines, but for this lesson, we're focusing on the Loomis head.</p>

<h2>Adjusting for Different Head Positions</h2>

<p>Let's move on to a head looking down. Start with the cranial ball. The side plane depends on the side-to-side turn and the tilt left and right. For a front angle, you'll see less of the side and more of the front. The oval will be narrower and tilted to match the head's angle.</p>

<p>The height of the oval relative to the ball stays the same. When the head tilts down, the brow ridge line wraps around the head. This line is parallel to the tilt of the head. From there, wrap the same parallel line across and drop another one down to the chin.</p>

<p>Consider foreshortening. The thirds will get smaller as they go away from you. Don't push it too much unless the camera is very close to the person. Keep in mind the person's type and adjust accordingly.</p>

<h2>Drawing a Side View Loomis Head</h2>

<p>For a side view, start with the cranial ball. The side plane is right in the middle of the circle. This side plane is about two-thirds of the height of the full circle. These measurements are for the perfect average person, but usually, you'll need to change proportions.</p>

<p>Drop a line from the forehead down to the chin. The middle of the circle marks the brow ridge. From there, draw a parallel line for the nose and drop an equal distance for the chin. The jaw starts at a perpendicular line in the middle.</p>

<p>The height and depth (width from front to back) of the head fit into a square. This measurement is from the tip of the nose to the back of the skull, not including the hair.</p>

<h2>Adapting the Loomis Method for Non-Average Proportions</h2>

<p>How do you apply this method to people who don't fit the average proportions? I'll show you in the next part of the series. Stay tuned for more tips on adapting the Loomis head to various shapes and proportions.</p>
