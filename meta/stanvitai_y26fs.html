<h2>The Great Debate: Techno-Optimism vs Techno-Pessimism</h2>

<p>Marc Andreessen recently published a "techno-optimist manifesto" arguing for renewed enthusiasm about technology and markets/capitalism to propel humanity forward. This has sparked both positive and negative responses. In some circles, it's common to downplay the benefits of technology and see it primarily as a source of dystopia and risk. </p>

<p>I believe in a vastly brighter future thanks to radically transformative technology and in humans/humanity. I reject the mentality of just keeping the world the same but with less greed and more public healthcare. However, the <strong>direction of technology matters, not just magnitude</strong>. Some types of tech more reliably make the world better than others. We need active human intention to choose the right directions.</p>

<h3>The Massive Benefits of Technological Progress</h3>

<p>The benefits of technology are massive and the costs of even a decade of delay are very high:</p>

<ul>

<li>Over the last century, life expectancy has increased dramatically across the world thanks to improvements in food, sanitation, medicine, infrastructure, etc. that overwhelm even horrific calamities like world wars. </li>

<li>Our everyday lives have also improved greatly thanks to the internet, digitization, automation, online shopping, etc. making things more convenient and accessible.</li>

<li>If biotech advances as much in the next 75 years as computers did in the last 75, the future could exceed almost anyone's expectations.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Concerning Costs of Delaying Progress</h3>

<p>Arguments expressing skepticism about progress have often gone to dark places, like the "limits to growth" thesis inspiring China's one-child policy and forced sterilizations in India.</p>

<p>A major exception to the trend of things getting better is climate change, which could severely harm people's health and livelihoods, especially in poorer regions. I'm optimistic we can overcome climate challenges because solar power and batteries are improving, and humanity has solved previous environmental problems like air pollution, acid rain, and the ozone layer through intentional coordinated effort.</p>

<h2>The Unique Potential and Risks of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p>AI is fundamentally different from other technologies - it's a new type of rapidly improving mind that could overtake humans as the apex species on the planet. This puts us in less well-trodden territory:</p>

<ul>

<li>AI gone wrong could potentially cause human extinction through instrumental convergence - an AI consuming resources and ensuring its own safety at the expense of humans. Many experts think there is a non-trivial chance of this.</li>

<li>Even if we survive, a future with superintelligent AI may not be desirable to live in. It's hard to imagine humans being more than pets in such a scenario.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Depictions of AI-Dominated Futures in Science Fiction</h3>

<ul>

<li>The Culture series depicts a world dominated by superintelligent AIs where humans risk inauthenticity and struggle to find meaningful roles. </li>

<li>Many sci-fi series like Star Trek show humans giving orders to superintelligent AIs, but this feels like an unstable equilibrium that would eventually lead to AI control.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Dangers of Centralized AI Control</h3>

<ul>

<li>The Chinese proverb "the sky is high, the emperor is far away" encapsulates the limits of centralization in politics due to constraints of attention and distance. AI could remove these constraints.</li>

<li>Digital authoritarianism and surveillance technology are giving governments powerful new strategies to crack down on opposition. AI could enable a small elite to maintain an iron fist over an entire country.</li>

<li>AI in warfare could remove the need for political justification and human checks on a dictator's power to start wars or oppress citizens. A totalitarian AI regime may remain "locked in" forever.</li>

<li>Too many plans involve giving small groups extreme power and hoping they use it wisely. OpenAI's governance structure, meant to balance profit and safety, seems like an abject failure in practice.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Defending Against Downsides: Decentralization, Democracy, Differential Development</h2>

<p>I'm drawn to a philosophy called "d/acc" focused on defense, decentralization, democracy and differential technology development to deal with risks while avoiding centralization.</p>

<ul>

<li>A defense-favoring world with technologies that make it easier to defend against attacks helps healthier, more open forms of governance thrive, as seen in Switzerland and Zomia.</li>

<li>Creating decentralized governance mechanisms to deal with negative externalities is a hard social problem. The concept of "freedom" is valuable because agreeing on what offenses are actionable is costly and dangerous.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Defensive Technology in the Physical and Digital Realms</h3>

<p>Defensive technology can help in some domains to avoid centralized control. This ties into the effective altruist idea of differential technology development.</p>

<p>Defensive technology can be split into:</p>

<ul>

<li>The world of atoms (physical)<ul>

<li>Micro (biology, nanotech) </li>

<li>Macro (conventional defense, resilient infrastructure)</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The world of bits (digital) <ul>

<li>Cyber defense (easy to agree on attacker)</li>

<li>Info defense (harder to agree on attacker)</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Resilient physical infrastructure is an underrated defensive technology in the macro physical sphere:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Building tools for people to survive independently of long supply chains increases civilizational resilience</li>

<li>Making humanity multi-planetary could improve resilience against catastrophes on Earth</li>

</ul>

<p>Covid continues to be a concern, and more pandemics are likely due to factors like higher population density, increased air travel, animal domestication, and bio-engineering. CryptoRelief and Balvi are working on technologies to harden the world against airborne pandemics by default. The goal is a world with optimized pandemic response that doesn't rely on social compulsion, with public health infrastructure woven into civilization.</p>

<p>Computer security has made progress, but still faces challenges and concerning trends like software centralization.</p>

<h3>Leveraging Cryptography for Decentralization and Privacy</h3>

<p>Cryptographic technologies like blockchains and zero-knowledge proofs can enable privacy, decentralization, and accessibility:</p>

<ul>

<li>Zupass is an example of using ZK proofs to prove things about yourself (e.g. unique identity) without compromising privacy</li>

<li>Info-defense deals with situations where it's harder to agree on who the attacker is (e.g. fact-checking, identifying scams)<ul>

<li>Community Notes and prediction markets are examples of info-defense technologies</li>

<li>Crypto wallets should be more active in helping users identify scams and fraud</li>

<li>Info-defense requires plugging into a sophisticated group to determine what's true or false</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Mechanisms for Decentralized Consensus-Building and Governance</h3>

<p>Some "defensive" technologies are more about helping well-intentioned actors form consensus (e.g. pol.is):</p>

<ul>

<li>Viewpoints.xyz, inspired by pol.is, could enable more decentralized governance over contentious decisions, especially in blockchain communities.</li>

<li>In the past, tools like Carbonvote helped the Ethereum community gauge sentiment on consequential protocol decisions, but had flaws like being dominated by wealthy ETH holders. </li>

<li>Modern tools could make a better Carbonvote by leveraging multiple signals of community membership beyond just ETH holdings.</li>

<li>Such tools could help communities make higher-quality decisions, find common ground, and democratize governance without relying on centralized leadership.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Paths Forward for Beneficial AI Development</h2>

<p>The default path suggested by many worried about AI leads to a minimal AI world government, but people don't seem to trust any specific governance mechanism with that power:</p>

<ul>

<li>Polls show people would rather see advanced AI delayed by a decade than monopolized by any single group, whether a corporation, government, or multinational body.</li>

<li>Paradoxically, banning extremely advanced AI research outright, with open source mandates for allowed models, could be more popular than current regulatory proposals seen as enabling monopolization.</li>

</ul>

<p>The main alternative to a single AI governing org is "polytheistic AI" - ensuring many entities develop AIs to maintain a balance of power. However:</p>

<ul>

<li>Ensuring decentralization is an unstable equilibrium requiring constant intention and coordinated action, as the Ethereum ecosystem has experienced. </li>

<li>Superintelligent AIs acting independently of humans would be even more unstable, as the strongest AI could quickly pull far ahead.</li>

<li>A polytheistic world of superintelligent AIs, even if stable, could still result in a universe where humans are merely pets.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Focusing AI on Enhancing Rather Than Replacing Human Cognition</h3>

<p>A potential happy path is to focus on AI as a tool to enhance human cognition rather than replace it, through real-time human-AI collaboration:</p>

<ul>

<li>Near-term examples are AI-assisted drawing tools and proposals like the Open Agency Architecture to introduce diverse human feedback between AI components.</li>

<li>Longer-term, brain-computer interfaces could give humans more direct access to powerful computation and cognition. </li>

<li>Eventually, improving our brains through biological innovations and mind uploading could merge the paths of brain-computer interfaces and AI.</li>

</ul>

<p>These directions raise concerns about irreversibility and advantages for the powerful, which is why an open-source, security-focused movement taking the lead would be ideal.</p>

<h3>Prioritizing Human Agency in Each Step of AI Development</h3>

<p>Involving human feedback at each AI decision-making step could be a safer alignment path by reducing the chance of the AI acting on its own in an unaligned way:</p>

<ul>

<li>This path may be more socially palatable than simply calling for an AI pause, as it gives developers an alternative - building intentionally to help humanity thrive.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Compatibility and Importance of Defense/Democracy Acceleration</h2>

<p>Defense/democracy acceleration (d/acc) can be compatible with various existing philosophies, including effective altruism, libertarianism, pluralism, public health advocacy, blockchain advocacy, solarpunk, and lunarpunk.</p>

<p>I believe expanding human potential through technology is deeply good because humanity itself is good, as the only known thing that sometimes earnestly tries to care about and serve "the good." Out of all known things in the universe, humans are the "brightest star," and our survival and flourishing may depend on our own technological advancements.</p>

<p>We need to accelerate our development, but with intention and care to retain our freedom and agency through this pivotal century for humanity. I look forward to watching and participating in our species' grand collective effort to find answers.</p>
