<h2>AI and Humanity</h2>

<h3>Concerns About AI</h3>

<p>I read an article by Andrew Morance in the New Yorker titled "Okay Doomer," which focuses on individuals concerned about AI's potential to destroy humanity. The article delves into the lives of AI safety advocates, also known as deep accelerationists, though the term is a bit of a mouthful. These individuals, many of whom reside in the Bay Area, are deeply concerned about the catastrophic potential of AI. They've even developed a metric for their concern, termed "P Doom," which stands for the probability of doom. Conversations among them often involve asking each other about their "P Doom" to gauge the level of concern about AI-induced apocalypse. I'm 90% sure AI might destroy humanity, which got me thinking about AI's impact on the daily lives of knowledge workers, especially concerning email management.</p>

<h2>AI in the Workplace</h2>

<h3>Current State of AI in Email Management</h3>

<p><strong>Limitations of current AI technologies in handling emails:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>AI's impact on the workplace is often discussed in terms of job automation, speeding up tasks, and aiding in brainstorming, but these don't address the core issue of the hyperactive hive mind workflow.</li>

<li>The hyperactive hive mind workflow, characterized by constant email and message checking, is a significant source of burnout and productivity loss among knowledge workers.</li>

<li>I envision AI as a chief of staff, managing communications efficiently, allowing workers to focus on one task at a time without constant context shifting.</li>

<li>This AI assistant could significantly increase productivity and job satisfaction by handling the cognitive load of managing communications.</li>

<li>However, this experiment also highlights the current limitations and the need for further development in AI for it to fully take over email management tasks.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Personal experiments with ChatGPT for email management:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>I experimented with ChatGPT to see how well it could manage emails, including summarizing messages and drafting responses.</li>

<li>ChatGPT was able to understand and summarize emails effectively and even draft polite responses, showing potential in managing email communication.</li>

<li>I've been using ChatGPT to help manage my email inbox by summarizing messages and drafting responses, but it only marginally speeds up the process.</li>

<li>Despite its assistance, I still need to manually direct the entire process, including making decisions and context switching, which doesn't significantly reduce my workload.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Managing the Hyperactive Hive Mind Workflow</h3>

<h2>Life Philosophy and Planning</h2>

<h3>Crafting a Remarkable Life</h3>

<p><strong>The importance of having a clear, aggressive vision for one's life:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>I believe in having an aggressive vision for my life, encompassing various aspects beyond just work, to create a life well-lived.</li>

<li>It's crucial to have clarity about what I'm trying to achieve with my life, which might involve dedicating more effort to something deeply important to me.</li>

<li>The vision for my life should be more than just filling free time with hobbies; it should lean into the possibilities of my life and be something that truly stands out.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Strategies for achieving a fulfilling life beyond work accomplishments:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>It's easier to deal with work-related ego issues when I'm proud of the entire life I've built, which is intentional and deep, with my work contributing to this life.</li>

<li>The more remarkable and deep the life I craft, the less significant work ego issues become, even if colleagues work longer hours, earn more, and receive more praise.</li>

<li>I aim to impact not just my job but also my family, community, and other areas I'm involved in, making my life remarkable in a literal sense, where people would find what I do interesting.</li>

<li>Simplifying and slowing down without a clear, remarkable vision can be a trap, leading to dissatisfaction and a sense of aimlessness.</li>
