<p>Welcome, I'm Michael Hampton. Today we're going to be talking about head drawing and construction. Specifically, we're going to talk about the basic setup. I go through about four steps to initiate the basic lay-in or gesture of a head drawing. This will cover just about every position that I could potentially see or set a head in. I've included a couple of skulls as reference points to help simplify these big ideas into manageable pieces.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Cranial Mass</h2>

<p>The first step is always dealing with the <strong>cranial mass</strong>, which is about two-thirds of the head. The easiest way to manage this is by starting with a basic sphere. </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pros of using a sphere</strong>: Easier to draw.</li>

<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Not very exact in terms of representing the human skull.</li>

</ul>

<p>A more accurate representation would be an <strong>egg shape</strong>. From a bird's eye view, the egg shape is more tapered and has a flat forehead, with the widest part towards the back of the skull. This shape is more reflective of the cranial mass.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Natural tilt</strong>: The skull naturally tilts and isn't perfectly horizontal or vertical.</li>

<li><strong>Gender differences</strong>: Men tend to have a more diagonal forehead tilt, while women have a more vertical tilt.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can also customize the cranial mass for character archetypes. For example, a square head might suit a stubborn character, while a longer, thinner rectangle might feel more elegant.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Tilts</h2>

<p>The second step is considering <strong>tilts</strong>. Early on, I often drew heads that were completely vertical, which looked static and lifeless. Tilts add expression and dynamism to the head drawing.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tilts</strong>: Think of the side-to-side lean of the head, neck, and shoulders.</li>

<li><strong>Expression</strong>: Tilts can convey a lot of non-verbal emotion.</li>

<li><strong>Historical context</strong>: In 17th-century portraiture, tilts were used to indicate arrogance. Today, we see similar tilts in selfies.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, once I have the cranial mass, I add a 2D axis to indicate the lean. This helps keep the head drawing dynamic and expressive.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Jaw and T/Cross</h2>

<p>The third step is introducing the <strong>jaw</strong> and using a <strong>T or cross</strong> for symmetry and proportion.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Front view</strong>: Pull the jaw down with C curves off the initial sphere, terminating at a straight line for the chin.</li>

<li><strong>Three-quarter view</strong>: The straight line of the chin shifts towards one side.</li>

<li><strong>Profile view</strong>: The chin becomes a point, indicating the turn of the jaw.</li>

<li><strong>Back three-quarter view</strong>: The jaw comes in front of the skull, showing the back or underside of the mandible.</li>

</ul>

<p>The T or cross helps find the center line of the chin and the symmetry line of the face, splitting it in half. The horizontal line aligns with the eyebrows.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Perspective</h2>

<p>The fourth step is considering <strong>perspective</strong>â€”whether you're drawing from above or below.</p>

<h3>Drawing from Below</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Cranial mass</strong>: Start with a sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Tilt</strong>: Indicate the head leaning back.</li>

<li><strong>Jaw</strong>: Adjust the jaw shape, moving the chin up into the skull.</li>

<li><strong>Ellipse</strong>: Use an ellipse to indicate perspective, inspired by Andrew Loomis. The ellipse should go from the brow to the top of the ear.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Drawing from Above</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Cranial mass</strong>: Start with a sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Tilt</strong>: Indicate the head leaning forward.</li>

<li><strong>Jaw</strong>: Adjust the jaw shape, making the neck longer and more S-like.</li>

<li><strong>Ellipse</strong>: Use an ellipse to indicate perspective, with the ear higher than the brow.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Common Mistakes</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Major axis</strong>: Ensure the major axis of the ellipse is at the center of the sphere. This helps maintain proportion and avoid a warped look.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>To recap, the four steps are:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Cranial Mass</strong>: Start with a sphere or egg shape.</li>

<li><strong>Tilts</strong>: Add expression through head, neck, and shoulder tilts.</li>

<li><strong>Jaw and T/Cross</strong>: Introduce the jaw and use a T or cross for symmetry and proportion.</li>

<li><strong>Perspective</strong>: Consider perspective with ellipses for above or below views.</li>

</ol>

<p>This approach is flexible and adaptable. Practice these steps to refine your technique and make your head drawings more dynamic and expressive.</p>
