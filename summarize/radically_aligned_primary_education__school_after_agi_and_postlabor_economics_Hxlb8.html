<p>In a hypothetical future, we need to radically align schools to better serve students and help them reach their maximum potential. To do this, we must first challenge our assumptions about the purpose of education and redefine it based on first principles.</p>

<h2>Redefining the Purpose of Education</h2>

<p>The distilled definition of education should be to <strong>help students reach their personal maximum potential</strong>. In a post-AGI and post-labor economics world, the economic imperative for children and adults goes away, and we can focus on creating thoughtful, civically engaged citizens who are good at communication.</p>

<h3>Important Skills and Subjects in a Hypothetical Future</h3>

<p>In this future, schools should focus on teaching:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Communication skills</strong>, including reading, writing, and basic literacy</li>

<li><strong>Civic literacy and history</strong> to create engaged citizens</li>

<li><strong>Building relationships and teamwork</strong> through activities that require collaboration and problem-solving</li>

<li><strong>Emotional intelligence</strong> to foster solid relationships</li>

<li><strong>Math, STEM, and programming</strong> to reshape the brain and provide durable neurological benefits</li>

<li><strong>Multiple languages</strong> to enhance cognitive development, especially in children with high neuroplasticity</li>

</ul>

<h2>Optimizing Education</h2>

<p>To achieve a radically aligned education system, we need to optimize the way education is designed. The key to a good education is <strong>more one-on-one time with tutors, mentors, and teachers</strong>. As job destruction happens in the future, more people should consider going into teaching to address the current shortage of teachers across all grade levels.</p>

<h3>Addressing Suboptimal Aspects of Current Education</h3>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Early school start times</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Current early start times (7:00-7:30 AM) are an indoctrination ritual dating back to the Industrial Revolution, conditioning children to deprive themselves of sleep and ignore their body's needs.</li>

<li><strong>Proposed solution</strong>: Start school at 9:00 or 10:00 AM, with before-school activities for socializing, playing, eating, and exercising.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Homework</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Homework is another means of conditioning children to believe their time is not their own, obligating them to be "on the clock" 24/7.</li>

<li>Science shows that more homework does not result in more learning.</li>

<li><strong>Proposed solution</strong>: Eliminate homework to teach children that their time and body's needs are their own when they're not under obligation to someone else.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<p>By radically aligning schools and education, we can create a future where students are empowered to reach their maximum potential, fostering a society of thoughtful, emotionally intelligent, and civically engaged individuals.</p>
