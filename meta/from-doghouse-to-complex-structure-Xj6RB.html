<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>You're assigned two projects for gestural perspective. The first project is easier, while the second is for level two. Everyone is encouraged to do both projects. Each project has two difficulty levels. The main focus is on <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>iterative improvement</strong>.</p>

<h2>Project 1: Deforming a Simple Structure</h2>

<h3>Warm-Up: Doghouse</h3>

<p>Start with a simple doghouse. Use deformation methods to create an interesting shape. Avoid random deformations; make purposeful changes. If a deformation doesn't look good, change it.</p>

<h3>Main Task: Complex Building</h3>

<p>Design a more complex structure, such as an apartment building, motel, cottage, house with a granny flat, or garage. Add multiple parts to the building, like a chimney, roof, or separate building. Deform parts of the structure to add interest, like curving walls. </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Make decisions with a purpose</strong> but also have fun and explore.</li>

<li><strong>Follow your gut</strong> and make changes if something looks wrong.</li>

<li><strong>Spend time on the project</strong> until you're proud of it.</li>

<li><strong>Iterate and improve your design</strong>; don't just copy the example.</li>

<li><strong>Practice multiple times</strong> to make it easier.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on adding gesture and personality</strong> to your forms, not just accurate perspective.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Project 2: Tree House</h2>

<p>For level two, try designing a tree house. This is trickier due to its organic shape and lack of a solid foundation. Emphasize <strong>creativity</strong> and handle the complexity of organic forms.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Another video with a different gestural perspective project will be available in a few days. Enjoy the process, try hard, and do your best.</p>
