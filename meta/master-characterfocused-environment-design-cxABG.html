<h2>Thinking on Characters</h2>

<p>When thinking about environments in your Marvel comic ideas, I like to introduce this concept that I call <strong>thinking on the characters</strong>. Whether it's Scarlet Witch, Doctor Strange, or any character in the Marvel universe, I try to think about what defines them as characters and how we can tell their story visually without saying a word of dialogue. This approach helps in designing and fleshing out the spaces where the characters exist.</p>

<p>For example, imagine Captain America taking a moment to work on one of his old World War II motorcycles. This scene grounds Captain America in a real way, contrasting with him flexing while punching Red Skull. You might think this seems boring, but trust me, this visual contrast is important for telling a good story. A quiet moment drawn well makes the action scenes more impactful.</p>

<h2>Designing Character-Reflective Environments</h2>

<p>Immediately, I think about treating the environment like it's its own character. It's not just a background; it's a place where the character literally walks around. What defines Captain America that we can add visually? Start by brainstorming ideas: high-waisted pants, neat, shield, old school, suspenders, patriotic, America. Adding these details breathes life into a character that doesn't actually exist.</p>

<h2>Thumbnailing and Choosing the Shot</h2>

<p>We're going to <strong>think on the characters</strong>, choose our shot, and make a map. When I say choose your shot, I mean designing a thumbnail that fits the storytelling moment. For Captain America reflecting on who he is, it's a quiet moment. What kind of shot fits this best? This is why we talked about different perspective grids earlier. We want a foundation to match the scene's vibe with the best environment and background shot.</p>

<p>I read a script and sketch an idea. Maybe a two-point perspective, going wide, with the garage opening dark. As I do this, I think about adding elements that define Captain America. For example, an American flag, Captain America with his hands in his pockets, and a cast shadow. If something works small, it will work big. Keep it simple.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the initial thumbnail might not work. For a quiet scene, a one-point perspective might be better. I might want a top-down shot, with Captain America in shadow, reflecting on his identity. Thumbnailing allows us to explore different ideas quickly.</p>

<h2>Creating a Map of the Environment</h2>

<p>After thumbnailing, I like to <strong>make a map</strong>. This step ensures I know where everything is, making it easier if the camera moves or if a fight happens in the scene. For example, in Captain America's garage, I do a quick top-down illustration based on the thumbnail. </p>

<p>Here's a simple map:

- Big American flag

- Tool bench

- Old fridge

- Motorcycle

- Another tool bench

- Something under a tarp</p>

<p>This map helps me understand the space better. If Scarlet Witch is in the scene, I know where everything is, making the drawing process smoother.</p>

<h2>Adding Specific Details and Using Reference Material</h2>

<p>Next, we <strong>scope the small details</strong>. This involves finding reference material to get things right. Being intentional with reference makes everything look better and more fun. For example, finding an image of a 1940s fridge helps sell the environment as Captain America's garage.</p>

<p>Don't let this overwhelm you. Find one image that helps and get going. You're not trying to draw a photo; you need specifics to add to your drawing. Artists like Chris Somni excel at this, making simple yet specific drawings that fit the time period.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Intentionality in Environment Design</h2>

<p>Making environments memorable and impactful involves intentional details. This approach makes environment drawing more fun and adds confidence. We are the budget for everything a reader sees in a comic book scene. Adding small, intentional details brings the story to life.</p>

<p>For instance, a 1950s garage barely changed over time. In movies, this would require an entire set piece. As artists, we need Google and a willingness to draw. Small intentional details on a desk or in a scene make a huge impact, helping readers connect with the story.</p>

<p>By thinking on characters, choosing the right shot, making a map, and adding specific details, we create environments that reflect our characters and enhance our storytelling.</p>
