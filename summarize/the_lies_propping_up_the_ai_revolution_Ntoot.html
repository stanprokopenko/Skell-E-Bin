<h2>The AI Revolution and Its Impact on Jobs</h2>

<p>The tech industry is facing a PR problem as the impact of AI on jobs becomes more apparent. In the beginning of 2024, we witnessed an onslaught of tech layoffs, with CEOs from IBM to UPS admitting that AI played a large role in their layoffs and hiring decisions. This is all being driven by the race to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), a generalized intelligence capable of outperforming the median human.</p>

<h3>The Future of Work: Humans and AI Collaboration</h3>

<p>As AI becomes more capable, you may find one or two humans working with an army of AI agents, outperforming what used to be a team of people. This is because AI, particularly large language models, are currently only capable of System One Thinking - fast, automatic, and largely unconscious. These models can quickly generate outputs based on recognized patterns, but lack the ability to consciously reason and plan. <strong>This is why the most powerful applications of AI today involve humans working together with AI agents.</strong> The AI can handle the fast, automatic tasks that require processing large amounts of data, while the human can provide the slower, more deliberate thinking that's necessary for making complex decisions. In this way, AI can augment and enhance human intelligence, but it can't replace the unique capabilities of the human mind - at least, not yet.</p>

<h2>The Role of Compute in the AI Revolution</h2>

<p>There is a ton of research at AGI labs around the world right now going into how to imbue more effective reasoning and planning skills into AI systems. <strong>Compute is going to be the currency of the future, maybe the most precious commodity in the world.</strong> The problem is one of scale - asking an AI system to cure cancer is a very different problem than asking it to fill in your tax form. The systems of the future will understand that and allocate more time and compute to harder problems. This is the reason Microsoft wants to invest $100 billion into building a supercomputing cluster known as Stargate, the largest infrastructure project in human history, to power the vast amounts of compute the world will need in the very near future. Just as energy enabled the third industrial revolution, ample and affordable compute will be the currency that powers the AI revolution or the fourth industrial revolution.</p>

<h3>Human Compute vs. Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<p>To get an AI system to think critically about a problem requires billions of dollars and massive amounts of energy and compute resources. The human brain can do the same thing, albeit much slower, but you can run one of these things with just a banana for energy. <strong>When it comes to tackling truly hard problems, human compute is still far more efficient and cost effective than artificial intelligence.</strong> Human creativity and ideas will remain the driving force behind innovation and progress, even while AI helps us to manifest those ideas into reality at a much quicker pace. The future is about ideas and creativity, and it belongs to those of us who understand how to leverage the hand that we've been dealt.</p>

<h2>The Dual Use Nature of AI</h2>

<p>Like all technology, AI is dual use. It can be used for good or for nefarious purposes. And how it's used is largely dependent on the cautiousness level of the society that builds it. The story of atomic energy serves as a warning here. When we discovered quantum physics in the midst of the beginning of World War II, instead of focusing on the immense energy opportunities now available to us, we channeled our understanding of the subatomic world into building the first weapon of mass destruction. We are at a similar choke point in history right now. <strong>The ability to generate deepfakes, realistic photos, videos, and just general propaganda is now capable of being cultivated and deployed by nefarious actors at an unprecedented scale. From now on, we should all be questioning everything we see.</strong> This is how we think critically, by questioning our core beliefs, by questioning what is real.</p>

<h3>Understanding Human Cognition in the Age of AI</h3>

<p>Most of the time we aren't really thinking about what we're doing. We can't, possibly. There's too much information to process. Too many variables. Our minds have to regulate our entire bodies. Over billions of years of evolution, nature has come up with a lot of shortcuts and ways of dealing with this complexity. When we are engaged in that automatic system one type thinking, that mode of unconscious thinking, it can feel like thoughts just appear in our heads. Human thought is deeply intertwined with emotions. Our brains index our memories based on the emotions we experience. As a consequence of this, when we experience intense emotions, our brains and bodies enter a programmable state. In this state, our minds and bodies are primed to remember and internalize experiences on a subconscious level. <strong>The people that develop these systems know this about us, which means in turn, AI knows this about us.</strong> By taking advantage of negativity bias, mixing in a little anchoring bias, and throwing in a dash of availability bias, the powers that be can keep us afraid and alone, knowing how to condition our automatic responses, keeping us susceptible to control.</p>

<h2>Thriving in the Age of AI: Developing an Opposable Mind</h2>

<p>As AI-facilitated content begins to dominate our world, it's crucial that we learn to think critically and creatively. We need to develop an opposable mind, the ability to hold two conflicting ideas in our head at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. The truth is not found in the extremes, but in the tension between them. <strong>Life isn't about avoiding tension and suffering, it's about facing them with bravery and purpose. It's about voluntarily stepping into discomfort, because we believe in something greater than our own temporary comfort.</strong> This is the basis of agency and intentionality. The fact that we are willing to sacrifice the present moment for a future that only exists as a dream in our head. This ability to direct our conscious attention is our superpower. It's what makes us powerful in a world that is becoming saturated with intelligence.</p>

<p>The ideas and beliefs that govern our subconscious tend to calcify over time if we let them. That's why it's so important to revisit old patterns of thinking with fresh eyes. When we can engage with ideas that don't make intuitive sense to us, we are training ourselves to sit with discomfort, holding space for the paradox and contradiction. The goal isn't for one idea to win over others, but rather to integrate diverse and even opposing perspectives to arrive at a more complete understanding. Truth isn't a battle to be won, but a puzzle to be pieced together.</p>

<p>So embrace the tension, embrace the chaos, allow your mind to be stretched and your perspective to be broadened. It's in this place of growth and expansion that we can begin to see the bigger picture. Because in order to not just survive, but thrive in the age of AI, we need to double down on what makes us uniquely human. So let us not run from that which challenges us, but bravely face it. And in doing so, discover who we really are and what we're truly capable of. If we can do that, AI will not conquer us, but empower us to become the highest version of ourselves so that we can focus on that which truly matters.</p>
