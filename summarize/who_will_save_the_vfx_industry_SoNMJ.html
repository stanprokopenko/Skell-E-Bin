<p>The rapid advancement of AI technology has brought us to a point where computers can generate realistic imagery and video with just a text prompt. This development is moving at such a fast pace that it's almost impossible to keep up with it. As AI algorithms become more advanced, they gain the capability to perform creative tasks traditionally done by humans, raising concerns about AI replacing human roles in creative industries.</p>

<p><strong>Questions arise about whether AI truly understands the art it creates.</strong> Is AI just a tool, or could it become a creator in its own right? In a world where artificial intelligence is so rapidly evolving, will AI replace us when it comes to making art and telling stories?</p>

<h2>The Unique Human Element in Art and Storytelling</h2>

<p>Art and storytelling are reflections of our human experience, our joys, sorrows, and dreams. It's an expression of ourselves that goes beyond algorithms and data. This is where AI falls short. It lacks our lived experiences because it's not alive.</p>

<p><strong>What makes art and storytelling so powerful is its ability to connect with people.</strong> It's that connection that really draws people to certain art, stories, and music. While AI can mimic forms and patterns, the essence of story and art goes deeper. If AI can't ever really know what it means to be human, how can it ever replace us in something that is so deeply rooted in the human experience?</p>

<p>Because of this, I don't think AI is going to replace people when it comes to art and storytelling. However, it almost certainly is going to have a major impact on the industry, and some of that will be felt in the jobs market.</p>

<h2>Predictions and Potential Scenarios for AI's Impact on the Animation Industry</h2>

<p>Jeffrey Katzenberg has made a prediction that 90% of the jobs in animation will be eliminated by AI within three years. He said that world-class animated movies that used to require 500 artists working over the course of 5 years will only take 10% of that workforce in the near future.</p>

<p>Let's consider a movie studio with 100 employees that outputs one feature film per year. If it implements an AI pipeline and only needs 10 employees to output one feature film per year, there are two potential outcomes:</p>

<ol>

<li>Continue to output one feature film per year and fire 90% of the employees.</li>

<li>Keep all employees and output 10 feature films per year to meet the growing demand.</li>

</ol>

<p>Another potential outcome is that if a small group of people can do what used to take a massive studio to do, those people might just go and start their own studio. Jobs may not get eliminated but instead move around a bit.</p>

<h2>The Current State of the VFX Industry</h2>

<p>According to a report, the global VFX market was valued at $28.8 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach a value of $65.45 billion by 2030, with an anticipated compound annual growth rate of 10.8%.</p>

<p>However, one of the growing concerns in the animation industry is that artists feel overworked. There have been several stories about the unsustainable working conditions artists find themselves in. Without mincing words, some claim that the VFX industry is on the verge of breaking down. Workers are missing major family milestones, sleeping in their offices, and sacrificing their weekends to save their jobs.</p>

<h2>AI as a Potential Solution to the VFX Industry's Challenges</h2>

<p>Given that AI can greatly increase the productivity of the workers who are already overworked, is it possible that rather than being the apocalypse that everyone thinks, it could be the savior of the VFX industry?</p>

<p>This is just my perspective, and I could be completely wrong. There's a lot of doom and gloom out there, and I'm not trying to say I know what's going to happen. The point is to put an alternate viewpoint out there to counter all the negative scenarios that I've seen.</p>
