<p>Demis Hassabis, a chess prodigy, video game designer, and neuroscientist, is playing a crucial role in helping Google regain its lead in the AI race. His background and competitive nature may be the key to Google's success in turning AI research into profitable products.</p>

<h3>Background and Early Achievements</h3>

<p>Hassabis' diverse background has shaped his approach to AI development:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Chess prodigy</strong>: Hassabis became the second highest-rated player in the world at the age of 17.</li>

<li><strong>Video game designer</strong>: He coded and led the design of the best-selling video game "Theme Park" at a young age and later founded his own video game company, Elixir Studios.</li>

<li><strong>Neuroscientist</strong>: Hassabis believes that the human brain is the only example of a general learning system that AI should mimic.</li>

</ul>

<h3>DeepMind and Google's AI Dominance</h3>

<p>Google acquired Hassabis' company, DeepMind, in 2014 for $500 million. Under his leadership, DeepMind achieved several key breakthroughs:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>AlphaGo</strong>: An AI program that beat the world's top Go player.</li>

<li><strong>AlphaFold</strong>: A groundbreaking technology that uses AI to predict the structure of proteins, which was open-sourced for the scientific community.</li>

</ul>

<p>However, Google's cautious approach to AI product development allowed competitors to gain ground.</p>

<h3>The Rise of OpenAI and ChatGPT</h3>

<p>Google's hesitancy to push AI technology with urgency allowed OpenAI to take the lead. The success of ChatGPT, which was built using Google's own research on Transformers, caught Hassabis off guard and prompted Google to become more aggressive in its AI efforts.</p>

<h3>Turning AI Research into Products</h3>

<p>Google is now focusing on commercializing its AI research, with Hassabis playing a key role in bringing AI to all Google products. Some notable developments include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>AlphaFold 3</strong>: The newly released version could be a multi-billion dollar business, with commercial partners like Eli Lilly and Novartis for drug discovery.</li>

<li><strong>AI in Google products</strong>: Hassabis' unit is working on bringing the latest AI technologies to every corner of Google, serving billions of users.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Competitive Edge</h3>

<p>Hassabis' extremely competitive nature and experience in shipping successful products, such as "Theme Park," may be the key to Google's success in the AI race. As Google consolidates its AI efforts and power around Hassabis, his leadership could help the company accelerate its progress in AI and turn research into profitable products.</p>
