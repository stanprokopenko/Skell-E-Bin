<p>As an immigrant, I've always been fascinated by how easily children seem to pick up new languages compared to adults. Even though we grown-ups are generally more competent in most areas, when it comes to learning a language, kids have a clear advantage. This is often evident in immigrant families, where the children quickly acquire the language of their new community while their parents struggle.</p>

<p>My mother, who grew up in a Yiddish-speaking household, tells a story about how she started correcting her parents' English as a young child. Her father would get furious, exclaiming, "The eggs are teaching the chickens!" But in the case of language acquisition, the eggs really do teach the chickens. Children pay preferential attention to language input from their peers compared to their parents, who often speak a heavily accented and error-prone version of the language.</p>

<h2>The Elusive Critical Period</h2>

<p>Intuitively, many people agree that the ability to learn a language must decline with age, possibly due to changes in brain plasticity. The concept of a critical period, or at least a sensitive period, for language acquisition during childhood is widely accepted. However, scientifically proving the existence of this critical period is not so straightforward.</p>

<p>Children differ from adults in many ways beyond just brain plasticity. They have an earlier start, more years of exposure and practice, and may be more willing to make mistakes and try new things. Additionally, the literature is vague about the exact age range of the critical period, with estimates ranging from 0-5 years old to a couple of years after puberty.</p>

<h2>Unscrambling the Egg: Our Online Language Quiz Study</h2>

<p>To shed light on this question, my former students Josh Hartshorne and Josh Tenenbaum and I conducted a study using data from an online language quiz designed to identify English dialects. The quiz went viral, gathering responses from 2/3 of a million people, many of whom had acquired English as a second language. This large dataset allowed us to analyze the critical window for language acquisition more effectively than smaller studies.</p>

<p>Our findings were surprising. It takes approximately 30 years to fully master the intricacies of a language, based on the quiz results. Immigrants who start learning English after age 12 never reach the same level of proficiency as native speakers. However, our mathematical analysis suggests that the underlying ability to learn a language only starts to decline around age 17.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that a 12-year-old starting to learn English will be as proficient as someone who has been learning since birth. They will only have five years before their language learning ability begins to decline. Nonetheless, the critical window appears to last much longer than previously thought.</p>

<h2>Unanswered Questions and Limitations</h2>

<p>Our study raises new questions about what happens at age 17 to cause this change in language learning ability. Is it due to changes in social life, brain wiring, or something else entirely? We don't have a clear answer yet.</p>

<p>It's also important to note that our study did not test for accent or pronunciation, which may have a different critical window than vocabulary, syntax, and semantics. Additionally, we found no advantage for boys over girls in language learning, despite girls typically undergoing puberty earlier. In fact, we observed an overall advantage for females, consistent with the well-known sex difference in language abilities.</p>

<p>In conclusion, our large-scale online study provides compelling evidence for a critical period in language acquisition that lasts until around age 17. While many questions remain unanswered, this research helps us better understand the remarkable ability of children to learn languages and the challenges faced by adult learners.</p>
