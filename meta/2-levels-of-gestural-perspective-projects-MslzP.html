<p>Welcome to our next assignment on gestural perspective! In this project, we'll be taking what we learned from the doghouse demo and applying it to more complex structures. I'm excited to see what you'll create!</p>

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>We have <strong>two projects</strong> lined up for our gestural perspective topic. While the first project is a bit easier, I encourage everyone to tackle both if you can. Don't worry if you're just starting out or if you're more advanced - we've got <strong>multiple difficulty levels</strong> for both projects to suit everyone's needs.</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>Our first project builds on the doghouse demo from our previous video. Your task is to <strong>take a simple structure and deform it</strong> in interesting ways. But don't stop there! The main goal is to <strong>design a more complex building</strong>, like an apartment, motel, or cottage.</p>

<p>Here's how to approach it:</p>

<ol>

<li>Start with a doghouse as a warm-up</li>

<li>Gradually make it more complex</li>

<li>Add multiple parts to your building</li>

<li>Extend and deform different sections of the structure</li>

</ol>

<p>For those looking for an extra challenge, try designing a <strong>treehouse</strong>. It's trickier because it lacks a solid foundation and you'll need to work with the organic shape of the tree.</p>

<h2>Approach and Techniques</h2>

<p>Remember, the key to this assignment is to <strong>make your deformations purposeful, not random</strong>. We want to add interest and personality to our structures. Here are some techniques to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use the <strong>six deformation methods</strong> we've discussed to add gesture and personality</li>

<li>Curve and deform elements to make them more interesting</li>

<li>Extend different parts of the building in various directions</li>

</ul>

<p>As you work, keep this process in mind:</p>

<ol>

<li>Start simple</li>

<li>Gradually add complexity</li>

<li>Deform purposefully</li>

<li>Iterate and refine</li>

</ol>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<p>To get the most out of this assignment:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Treat it as a project</strong>, not just a task to complete quickly</li>

<li><strong>Iterate and improve</strong> until you're satisfied with your work</li>

<li>If you finish quickly, <strong>do multiple versions</strong> to practice</li>

<li>Keep at it until the process becomes easy and natural</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, this should be <strong>fun and exploratory</strong>. If a design choice doesn't work, simply erase it and try something else. The goal is to spend time on your project and create something you're proud of.</p>

<h2>Encouragement and Next Steps</h2>

<p>I want you to really <strong>enjoy this process</strong>. Be exploratory, be creative, and most importantly, do your best! We have another video on gestural perspective coming soon, but don't wait for it. Keep practicing and experimenting with these techniques while you wait for the demo.</p>

<p>This assignment is all about growth and exploration. Don't be afraid to push your boundaries and try new things. I can't wait to see what you all come up with. Good luck, and happy drawing!</p>
