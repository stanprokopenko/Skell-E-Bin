<p>In this lesson, you'll add muscles to a skeleton sculpture of a hand. Use the provided 3D model reference and focus on <strong>intrinsic muscles</strong>, which are located from the wrist up, mainly in the palm and back of the hand. Remember, muscle bellies do not extend into the digits or phalanges.</p>

<h2>Materials and Preparation</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Types of clay</strong>: Use simple strips of clay for adding muscles. If using polymer clay for bones, use non-dry modeling clay for muscles to allow for later removal.</li>

<li><strong>Color differentiation</strong>: Consider using a different color for muscles, such as reddish clay, to distinguish them from bones.</li>

<li><strong>Mixing materials</strong>: Mix microcrystalline wax with red wax from Babybel cheese for a suitable muscle material.</li>

</ul>

<h2>General Guidelines</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Adding muscles</strong>: Pay attention to connection points and general shape. Keep muscles flat and removable to avoid damaging the underlying sculpture.</li>

<li><strong>Starting point</strong>: Begin with deep muscles and work outward.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Muscle Addition</h2>

<h3>Opponens Pollicis</h3>

<ul>

<li>Add a rectangular strip from the metacarpal of the thumb to a wrist bone.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adductor Pollicis Transverse</h3>

<ul>

<li>Add a triangular muscle from the middle phalanx of the thumb to the middle palm.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adductor Pollicis Brevis</h3>

<ul>

<li>Attach this muscle to the middle phalanx of the thumb.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Flexor Pollicis Brevis Superficialis</h3>

<ul>

<li>Add a longer, thinner triangular muscle.</li>

</ul>

<h3>First Lumbrical</h3>

<ul>

<li>Attach this muscle to the outside part of the first knuckle of the pointer finger.</li>

</ul>

<h3>First Palmar Interosseous</h3>

<ul>

<li>Attach this muscle to the inside part of the first knuckle of the pointer finger.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Third Lumbrical</h3>

<ul>

<li>Add a bipennate muscle between the middle and ring fingers.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Third Palmar Interosseous and Fourth Lumbrical</h3>

<ul>

<li>Both muscles attach to the inside part of the pinky.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Opponens Digiti Minimi</h3>

<ul>

<li>Add this muscle from the wrist bones to the metacarpal of the pinky.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adductor Digiti Minimi</h3>

<ul>

<li>This is a larger muscle of the pinky.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Palmaris Brevis</h3>

<ul>

<li>Add a strip-like muscle that helps grip by pinching the skin of the pinky mass.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Dorsal Interosseous Muscles</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>First dorsal interosseous</strong>: A teardrop-shaped muscle at the back of the thumb.</li>

<li><strong>Fourth dorsal interosseous</strong>: Located between the pinky and ring finger.</li>

<li><strong>Third and second dorsal interosseous muscles</strong>: Add these as well.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Assignment and Practice</h2>

<p>Completing assignments is crucial for learning and improvement. Dedicate about 30-40 minutes to add these muscles to your hand sculpture. Submit images of your work for critiques and feedback.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>After following these steps, you should have a detailed hand sculpture with muscles.</p>
