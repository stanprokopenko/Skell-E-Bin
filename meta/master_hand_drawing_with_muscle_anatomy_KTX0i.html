<p>Hi, I'm Stan Prokopenko, and this is Proko. Today, we're diving into a highly requested topic: how to draw hands. We're embarking on a four-part series, starting with the muscles of the hand. Let's get into it.</p>

<p>Drawing hands is a challenge many of you have asked about. We've previously explored the bones of the hand, which are crucial for understanding its proportions and range of motion. If you haven't seen that lesson, I recommend checking it out. Now, we're moving beyond bones to cover everything else about hands, including muscles, surface details, drawing processes, and step-by-step demos. It's going to be an exciting journey for anyone looking to improve their hand drawing skills.</p>

<h2>Muscles of the Hand</h2>

<p><strong>Thenar Eminence</strong></p>

<p>The thenar eminence, or the thumb mass on the palm side, is our starting point. It's the most prominent muscle mass in the palm, originating from the wrist and attaching along the thumb bones. This mass is made up of three muscles: <strong>Opponens Pollicis, Flexor Pollicis Brevis, and Abductor Pollicis Brevis</strong>. Each plays a role in the thumb's movement, with the abductor pollicis brevis being particularly interesting for its ability to abduct and medially rotate the thumb. Understanding these muscles helps us grasp the thumb's complex motions, including flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, opposition, and reposition.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the thenar eminence, the <strong>adductor pollicis</strong> muscle is worth noting. Though not easily visible, it influences the design of skin folds between the thumb and index finger by adducting the thumb.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothenar Eminence</strong></p>

<p>The hypothenar eminence, or the pinky muscle mass, is narrower and not as thick as the thumb mass. It consists of four muscles: <strong>Opponens Digiti Minimi, Flexor Digiti Minimi Brevis, Abductor Digiti Minimi, and Palmaris Brevis</strong>. The abductor digiti minimi is the most visible, playing a key role in abducting the pinky. The palmaris brevis, unique for its perpendicular orientation, pulls the skin inward to improve grip.</p>

<p><strong>First Dorsal Interosseous</strong></p>

<p>The first dorsal interosseous muscle fills the gap between the thumb and index finger metacarpals, creating a visible bulge. It abducts the index finger and adds depth to the hand's anatomy. When drawing this area, focus on the overlaps to convey depth accurately.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Muscles</strong></p>

<p>Briefly, the lumbricals are four worm-like muscles on the palm side, originating on the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and inserting on the extensor tendons. They're interesting for their role in flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints and extending the interphalangeal joints, though they're rarely visible due to palmar fat.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Your task is to draw hand quick-sketches, concentrating on the three fleshy masses we've discussed. Aim for drawings that capture good gesture and simple 3D form, using a balance of straights and curves. Pay attention to the superficial bony areas and ensure your muscle forms attach correctly to the bones. Share your drawings in the Facebook Anatomy Group for feedback and the chance to be featured in a critique video.</p>

<p>Drawing hands can be complex, but understanding the underlying anatomy is a significant first step. Stay tuned for more lessons and demonstrations in this series.</p>
