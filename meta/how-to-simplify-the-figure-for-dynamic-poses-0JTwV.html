<p>Understanding how to simplify the figure is key to drawing believable poses. Start with a gesture drawing and construct simplified forms on top.</p>

<h2>Gesture Drawing Basics</h2>

<p>Begin with a simple sphere and develop the gesture based on 16 to 17 lines. Gesture simplifies the directional aim of a part, and the spacing between lines represents joints.</p>

<h2>Considering Different Views</h2>

<p>Consider different views: front, front three-quarter, and more challenging angles.</p>

<h2>Observing Weight Distribution</h2>

<p>Observe weight distribution and use wrapping lines to indicate volume. Use long relational rhythms in passive parts of the body for a natural look.</p>

<h2>Drawing Arms and Elbows</h2>

<p>For arms crossing the body, note the elbow's position and the overall directional balance.</p>

<h2>Reference Points for Balance</h2>

<p>Use the pit of the neck as a reference point for balance; a stable pose aligns this point with the weight-bearing ankle. Push poses to avoid overly balanced stances.</p>

<h2>Constructing Shapes</h2>

<p>Construct shapes: pelvis, rib cage, and connections. Use symmetry line landmarks: pit of the neck, belly button, pelvis.</p>

<h2>Indicating Rotation and Twists</h2>

<p>A C-curve in the symmetry line indicates a directional rotation or dimensional turn. For twists, use an S-curve: rib cage and pelvis face opposite directions. Manage twists with asymmetrical triangles representing muscle attachments.</p>

<h2>Constructing Rib Cage and Pelvis</h2>

<p>Construct boxes for rib cage and pelvis, ensuring parallel lines for width, depth, and height.</p>

<h2>Drawing Limbs</h2>

<p>Avoid using tapered cylinders for limbs early on; focus on bone direction and perspective.</p>

<h2>Drawing Legs</h2>

<p>For legs, use rhythm lines to establish width and form, then add muscle and fat.</p>

<h2>Studying Feet</h2>

<p>Study feet by constructing basic shapes and foreshortening them. Use a deck of cards analogy for the foot's structure, considering its arches.</p>

<h2>Drawing Arms</h2>

<p>For arms, create perspectives and use cylinders for upper and lower arms. Draw through forms to see all sides and complete ellipses.</p>

<h2>Drawing Hands</h2>

<p>For hands, use a two-by-four analogy to understand planes and connections.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Lyrical Feeling</h2>

<p>Maintain a lyrical feeling in construction to avoid stiffness. Over-exaggerate gestures to anticipate stiffening during construction.</p>

<h2>Combining Gesture and Anatomy</h2>

<p>Combine gesture and anatomy for a comprehensive approach to figure drawing.</p>
