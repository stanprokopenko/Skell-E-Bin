<p>This week, we're kicking things off with a simple yet fundamental painting assignment. We'll be focusing on painting a <strong>red rubber ball</strong>, starting with a <strong>black and white version</strong>. This task is designed to ease you into the painting process, familiarizing you with basic techniques and tools.</p>

<h2><strong>Preparing for the Assignment</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Selecting the Right Brush in Different Software</strong></h3>

<p>To ensure everyone can participate, regardless of their preferred digital painting software, I've selected specific brushes for each program:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Photoshop</strong>: Use the <strong>JV Chalky</strong> brush.</li>

<li><strong>Krita</strong>: Opt for the <strong>Wet textured soft brush</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Affinity Photo</strong>: The <strong>Classic Oil Smooth</strong> brush is your go-to.</li>

<li><strong>Clip Studio Paint</strong>: Select the <strong>Gouache</strong> brush under thick pastels.</li>

<li><strong>Procreate</strong>: The <strong>Turpentine</strong> brush is recommended.</li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>Downloading and Importing Brushes</strong></h3>

<p>For those using Photoshop, you'll need to download a set of brushes, including the JV Chalky brush. Here's how:</p>

<ol>

<li>Download the brush file from the provided link.</li>

<li>Unzip the file to obtain a .abr file type.</li>

<li>In Photoshop, go to the brush settings, click the gear icon, and select <strong>import brushes</strong>.</li>

<li>Import the .abr file to access the brushes, including JV Chalky.</li>

</ol>

<h2><strong>Painting Techniques and Tips</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Starting the Painting</strong></h3>

<ul>

<li>Open the black and white image of the ball and create a new layer.</li>

<li>Use the color picker to select colors directly from the image as you paint.</li>

<li>Begin by painting the base layers, such as the table and the initial shape of the sphere.</li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>Developing the Painting</strong></h3>

<ul>

<li>Adjust the brush size with bracket keys for detailed work.</li>

<li>Embrace the simplicity of using just one brush, without undo, multiple layers, or blending techniques.</li>

<li>Focus on capturing the sphere's form and shadows, staying loose and experimenting with brush pressure.</li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>Finishing Touches</strong></h3>

<ul>

<li>Refine your painting by cleaning up lines and perfecting the sphere's appearance.</li>

<li>Aim to spend no more than an hour on this task, though you're welcome to take longer if needed.</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Assignment Goals and Expectations</strong></h2>

<p>The primary objective of this assignment is to get you comfortable with digital painting tools and techniques. Here's what I expect:</p>

<ul>

<li>Complete at least <strong>three black and white images</strong> of the sphere.</li>

<li>If you're up for a challenge, try painting the color version of the ball.</li>

<li>For mentored students, please post your images on Discord for feedback.</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Demonstration and Encouragement</strong></h2>

<p>To demonstrate that this assignment is achievable with the tools and techniques outlined, I've included a sped-up video of me painting a more complex study of the ball in color. This should serve as both proof and inspiration.</p>

<p>Remember, the focus of this week's assignment is on simplicity and getting accustomed to painting. Next week, we'll dive deeper into the painting process, building on the skills you've started to develop. So, grab your digital brush and let's start painting!</p>
