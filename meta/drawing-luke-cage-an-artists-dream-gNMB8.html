<h2>Discovering My Love for Comics and Art</h2>

<p>My passion for art began before my interest in comics. As a child, I was drawn to the cartoons on television and tried to capture those moving images on paper. It was a challenge at my young age, but when I discovered comic books around the age of six, I realized that they were essentially still images of the cartoons I loved. This made it easier for me to learn from and copy the characters and stories.</p>

<p>My mom noticed my interest in the spinner racks at our local store and encouraged me to read the comics if I wanted to buy them. This simple gesture opened the floodgates to my obsession and love for the medium. Little did I know that by copying the images from these comics, I was also learning the fundamentals of drawing forms and shapes.</p>

<h3>The Impact of Luke Cage</h3>

<p>As a young black kid, seeing Luke Cage, a hero with the same skin color as mine, had a profound impact on me. At the time, I didn't fully grasp the significance of his presence alongside iconic characters like Captain America, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and Wolverine. Years later, I realized how much it meant to see a character who looked like me as part of that pantheon. It inspired me to learn more about Luke Cage and fueled my desire to draw and create stories featuring him.</p>

<h2>Breaking into the Comic Book Industry</h2>

<p>My journey into the professional comic book industry began at Heroes Con in Charlotte, North Carolina. This convention holds a special place in my heart because it's where I, as a young and clueless creator, got my first opportunities. I met many aspiring creators who are now prominent figures in the industry, such as Jonathan Hickman and Scotty Young.</p>

<p>I stood in long lines, showed my work to anyone who seemed interested, and eventually landed some small projects and short stories at Dark Horse Comics and DC Comics. These were perfect assignments for a young artist just starting out. From there, I kept plugging away, working hard, and staying connected with those who showed interest in my work. Persistence was key, and gradually, I received more opportunities to showcase my skills.</p>

<h2>Reimagining Luke Cage for Marvel</h2>

<p>When Marvel asked me to reimagine Luke Cage and bring new stories to the character, it felt like a dream come true â€“ a full-circle moment. With the upcoming TV series in mind, I used images from the show to guide my visual direction for the character. I also had the privilege of connecting with Mike Colter, the actor portraying Luke Cage, and used our conversations as inspiration.</p>

<p>To create Luke Cage's updated look, I considered various elements such as men's fashion, traditional Marvel hero visuals, and the character's iconic color scheme of blue and yellow-gold. It was a blend of different influences coming together to shape his new appearance.</p>

<h3>Creating Danny Rand's Look</h3>

<p>For Danny Rand, I wanted to give him a unique aesthetic that would set him apart. I drew inspiration from the "Enter the Dragon" tracksuit style, combining different genres to create a fresh look for the character.</p>

<h2>Admiration for Diverse Characters</h2>

<p>In today's comic book landscape, I'm a huge fan of characters like Miles Morales and Black Panther. Miles, in particular, resonates with me because he represents this generation's character that has impacted black and brown kids worldwide, much like how Luke Cage inspired me as a child. I admire these characters for their ability to represent diversity in comics and inspire readers from all backgrounds.</p>

<p>Looking back on my journey, from falling in love with comics at a young age to working in the industry professionally for nearly 20 years, I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had and the characters I've been able to bring to life. The passion that began with copying images from spinner racks has evolved into a fulfilling career, and I'm excited to continue creating and inspiring others through the power of comic books.</p>
