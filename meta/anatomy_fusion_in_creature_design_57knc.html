<h2>Studying Anatomy</h2>

<p>When I dive into studying anatomy, I like to tackle it in <strong>two stages</strong>. Initially, I focus on the <strong>bone structure</strong>. This involves looking at the foundational elements like the shoulder blade and arm bones of animals, for instance, cats. I examine how muscles wrap around these bones. After grasping the bone structure, I move on to the <strong>form</strong> or the simplistic version of what we see on the outside. For example, I simplify the arm and paw of a cat into a tube shape. This approach of starting with the bone structure and then simplifying it helps me gain a <strong>better understanding of the creature's anatomy</strong>.</p>

<h2>Creature Design Process</h2>

<p>Creating unique creatures is something I thoroughly enjoy. I often combine different animal anatomies, like merging reptile and cat anatomy, to come up with something truly unique. To help memorize the form of creatures, I use <strong>wire form anatomy structures</strong>. This technique is particularly useful for remembering specific postures, such as the flat posture of lizards or the regal stance of cats.</p>

<p>In my designs, I like to incorporate specific elements that I find appealing. For instance, I'm drawn to dragons with <strong>frail legs and big eyes</strong>. I've also explored incorporating <strong>chameleon eyes</strong> into a design and designing a dragon with <strong>angler fish characteristics</strong>, including a lure that mimics gold coins to attract prey. Another interesting concept I worked on was a dragon with a rattle that sounds like gold coins clattering, adding to its deceptive nature.</p>

<h2>Developing Personal Style</h2>

<p>Developing a personal style is a <strong>gradual process</strong>. It involves pulling bits and pieces from both the real world and artists we admire. Over time, I've developed my own style by focusing on elements I'm particularly drawn to in dragons and other creatures. Experimenting with new materials in art making has also been crucial for discovering my personal preferences and identifying gaps in my skills.</p>

<h2>Fantasy Creatures and Inspiration</h2>

<p>The realization that fantasy creatures like unicorns and dragons don't exist left a big hole in my life. However, drawing them fills that void. Designing dragons with unique characteristics and behaviors is particularly fulfilling. I also find it rewarding to encourage creativity in children at conventions. Having a book published allows me to influence others, much like how art books influenced me as a child.</p>

<h2>Artistic Techniques and Teaching</h2>

<p>In my drawings, I pay attention to <strong>overlapping elements</strong> like tails and feet, as this adds dimension and realism. I also focus on <strong>folds and creases at joints</strong> to show form changes, especially in reptile drawings. On Instagram, I break down the <strong>storytelling process in art</strong>, a skill I learned over time. I believe it's never too late to start learning art, as demonstrated by my mother who pursued graphic design in her 40s.</p>

<h2>Support and Sharing</h2>

<p>The support from my parents was crucial in pursuing art as a career. They showed me that anyone can become a professional artist with dedication. I enjoy sharing my art and techniques through social media and publications. Creating a <strong>Proko dragon</strong> inspired by a kangaroo meme and incorporating elements like a baby dragon drawing with charcoal adds a personal touch to my designs.</p>

<h2>Contributions to the Art Community</h2>

<p>My book, published with 3D Total, covers my art journey from middle school through learning and developing skills. It includes detailed tutorials on painting water and breaking down illustrations. I encourage further engagement through social media platforms like Instagram or Twitter, where I share more about my art and techniques.</p>
