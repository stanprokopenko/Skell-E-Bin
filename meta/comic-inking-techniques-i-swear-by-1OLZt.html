<p>We started with rough drawings of our heroes in action and then penciled them in. Now, I'll show you some of my inking techniques when I approach characters. We won't finish this whole page, but you'll see my process on a few of these characters in the foreground.</p>

<h2>Tools and Techniques</h2>

<p>I use a <strong>Pilot brush pen</strong> for its good control and line weights. The lines aren't super thick, and I can get some good feathering. However, the ink sometimes sits on the paper instead of soaking in, which can be problematic if I accidentally move my hand over it. To manage this, I blow on the page to speed up the drying. I start on the left-hand side and move towards the right to avoid smudging.</p>

<p>I also use a <strong>Pintail brush</strong> with synthetic hairs. The ink in these pens runs out quickly, and the quality isn't top-notch, so I prefer dipping it in my own ink. This gives me more control over the amount of ink on the brush. Squeezing the pen can cause excess ink to fill up quickly, making it hard to control.</p>

<h2>Workflow and Process</h2>

<p>I usually start with the body, but sometimes I begin with the face if I know it will take a while to dry. While the face dries, I work on the bigger forms to see the overall composition take shape. It's important to take deep breaths and not clench up, as this can affect the quality of the lines.</p>

<p>I break down pages based on difficulty: difficult, semi-difficult, and easy. This helps me balance my workload and not feel overwhelmed by challenging pages. I work on one of each type to keep things balanced.</p>

<h2>Mental Aspects of Art</h2>

<p><strong>Self-doubt</strong> is something every artist struggles with. It's called imposter syndrome. You might second-guess yourself or compare yourself to others, which is a big issue. Instead of letting others' work discourage you, let it inspire you. Remember, no one becomes great overnight. It takes years of practice and dedication.</p>

<p>When working on projects, it's crucial to remember why you started in the first place. The excitement of a new assignment can fade during the day-to-day grind, but keeping the bigger picture in mind helps maintain motivation. Feedback and critiques are part of the process and are meant to help you improve.</p>

<h2>Practical Advice and Tips</h2>

<p>To avoid burnout, take breaks and clear your mind. I go for walks or engage in activities like sports to de-stress. It's essential to do something away from the desk to keep your mind fresh.</p>

<p>For final touches, I use <strong>correction ink</strong> to clean up any blotchy areas. This helps tighten up the overall look of the piece.</p>

<p>In conclusion, thumbnailing and penciling all seven characters and inking four of them should give you a good idea of how I approach this assignment. Good luck with your own work, and see you next time!</p>
