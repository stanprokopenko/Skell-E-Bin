<h2>What is Gesture?</h2>

<p>Gesture, also known as rhythm, motion, action, or flow, refers to the <strong>movement that connects the contours, forms, and tones</strong> in a drawing. It's not about the details, but rather the fluid motion that brings the figure to life. For example, if you have three balls, the gesture would be the C curve describing their relationship, not the individual contours.</p>

<p><strong>Gesture is more important than details.</strong> Details are nothing without gesture, and while you might accidentally find some gesture while copying contours, it's better not to rely on accidents. Instead, practice finding the gesture of the figure so many times that it becomes second nature.</p>

<h3>Quicksketch Exercise</h3>

<p>Quicksketch is a common exercise in art school that involves <strong>drawing the model from life within a few minutes.</strong> A typical session lasts 2-3 hours, with poses ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes per pose. The primary concern is gesture.</p>

<p>Regular quicksketch practice offers several benefits:</p>

<ul>

<li>Trains you to see gesture immediately</li>

<li>Allows you to design details that complement the gesture</li>

<li>Leads to improvement with each new concept learned</li>

<li>Provides a fun and rewarding experience</li>

</ul>

<p>During a normal session, you'll finish anywhere from 25 to 100 drawings, which means you're drawing the human figure up to 100 times within a few hours. If you do this regularly, you're going to get better, and the best part is that it's actually fun if you don't stress over it.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts for Gesture Drawing</h2>

<h3>Telling a Story</h3>

<p>Use gesture to <strong>capture body language and convey ideas and emotions.</strong> Consider what the person is doing, feeling, or about to do, and express that through just a few lines that viewers can recognize. Exaggerating the pose can help tell a better story and improve your ability to capture subtleties.</p>

<h3>Action Lines</h3>

<p>Instead of thinking of your lines as stick figures, think of them as <strong>fluid action lines representing movement.</strong> Observe and analyze the movement, focusing on how it feels rather than how it looks. You can add structure later to make the figure feel more solid and real.</p>

<h3>Longest Axis</h3>

<p>When looking for the gesture in a form, <strong>look for the longest axis,</strong> such as down the length of the torso, leg, or arm. This is where you'll find the fluid motion from one form to the next.</p>

<h3>CSI (Simple Lines)</h3>

<p>To eliminate unnecessary information and capture gesture effectively, <strong>use simple lines: C curves, S curves, or straight lines.</strong> Try to use combinations of these curves in as few lines as possible.</p>

<h3>Line of Action</h3>

<p>Start by <strong>finding the longest action line of the body,</strong> which is a curve that connects the head to the toes, if possible. This main line shows the directional flow of the pose. If one line isn't enough to tell the whole story, break the pose into parts, such as a C curve for the torso and S curves for the legs.</p>

<h3>Relaxed and Tense Curves</h3>

<p>The "bendiness" of the curve affects the feeling of the gesture. <strong>Longer, fluid curves feel relaxed,</strong> while <strong>more bent curves show energy and tension.</strong> A zig zag indicates sharp corners and sudden changes. Think of examples in nature, like calm water flowing in an S curve rhythm versus stormy water flowing in a zig zag pattern.</p>

<h3>Asymmetry of the Body</h3>

<p>Consider the <strong>asymmetrical aspect of the body from the side,</strong> with alternating angles of the head, ribcage, pelvis, upper leg, and lower leg. This creates alternating C curves that lead the eye through the body, like a river flowing through a stream.</p>

<h2>Practicing Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>Before watching the step-by-step video, attempt to practice these concepts on your own. This way, you'll have an idea of what it's like, and you can pull more information from the video because you know what to look for. You'll have questions to focus on and can compare your attempts with the instructor's examples.</p>
