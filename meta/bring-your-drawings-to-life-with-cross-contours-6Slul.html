<p>If you've ever struggled to make your drawings feel three-dimensional, cross contours could be a game changer for you. They're super helpful for constructing forms, shading details, and improving your ability to visualize your drawings in 3D. In this guide, we'll break down how they work and help you avoid common mistakes.</p>

<h2>What is Cross Contour?</h2>

<p><strong>Cross contours</strong> are lines that wrap around the form of an object, helping to describe its three-dimensional qualities. While we often think of objects in terms of their outlines or contours, cross contours help us visualize the internal structure. This is especially useful for organic or complex forms.</p>

<p>Imagine a wireframe wrapping around the form. It takes time to train your mind to switch from thinking about contours to thinking about cross contours. The goal is to imagine the form and then draw a few key cross contours that help communicate that form.</p>

<h2>Drawing Cross Contours</h2>

<p>Start by imagining one cross contour line at a time. Think of it like an ant trail. If a colony of ants marched across the form, what would that trail look like?</p>

<h2>Examples of Cross Contours</h2>

<h3>Drawing a Sausage</h3>

<p>A simple contour outline of a sausage doesn't tell us much about its 3D qualities. By adding an ellipse as a cross contour, you create the illusion that the sausage has thickness and is cylindrical.</p>

<h3>Drawing a Banana</h3>

<p>For a banana, you need to show its hard edges. Without them, it might look like a croissant or a potato. The way you describe the form on the inside becomes crucial, especially for more complicated forms like a face or a torso.</p>

<h2>Spacing of Cross Contour Lines</h2>

<p>How far apart should you draw these lines? Typically, one to three cross contour lines per chunk of a form is a good rule of thumb. It depends on the size of the form and how much it changes. For example, on a forearm, you might draw two cross contour lines: one at the wrist and one at the meaty area.</p>

<h2>Indicating Foreshortening with Spacing</h2>

<p>Spacing relationships can indicate foreshortening. For example, if you look at a roly-poly from the side, the segments are evenly spaced. But from a different angle, the segments appear closer together as they move away from you. This spacing helps show depth.</p>

<h2>Curviness of Cross Contour Lines</h2>

<p>The shape of the cross contour lines describes the form. For example, a flat ellipse indicates a flat fish, while a rounder ellipse indicates a fatter fish. The orientation of the form also affects the curviness of the lines.</p>

<h3>Examples with a Fish and a Macaroni</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Fish</strong>: A flat ellipse describes a flat fish, while a rounder ellipse indicates a fatter fish.</li>

<li><strong>Macaroni</strong>: Depending on the orientation, the middle part might be bigger or smaller, and the ends will be more rounded.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Organic Forms and Overlaps</h2>

<p>When drawing organic forms, the overlap can change the illusion. For example, if one part of a blob overlaps another, it changes how you draw the cross contours. This helps in showing which part is coming towards or moving away from the viewer.</p>

<h2>Importance of Ends in Cross Contours</h2>

<p>Don't be lazy with the ends. These lines need to wrap all the way around the form. The ends usually have the most curve because they wrap around the form's edges. A common mistake is to make the ends the flattest parts, which can make the form look flat.</p>

<h2>Cross Contours on Multiple Axes</h2>

<p>You can draw cross contour lines along any of the three axes. For example, imagine an ant trail wrapping around the form in different directions. This creates a very three-dimensional wireframe around the object.</p>

<h2>Center Lines</h2>

<p>Center lines are crucial for showing the orientation of the form. They can also be used to show gesture. For example, a center line on a face can help you place features accurately. </p>

<h3>Example with a Potato Head</h3>

<p>Imagine a potato head looking up and to the left. The center line would wrap around the bottom, indicating that the head is tilted upwards. This makes it easier to place features like the eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>

<h2>Twisting Forms</h2>

<p>When forms twist, the center line isn't as simple as a C curve. For example, a torso might twist, creating an S curve. This can be reinforced with proper overlaps to show the twist more clearly.</p>

<h2>Levels of Simplicity</h2>

<p>Cross contour lines can represent a simplified version of the form. They don't have to follow all the details. For example, on a face, you might just use a curve to represent the head. The level of simplicity depends on the purpose of your drawing.</p>

<h2>Shading with Cross Contour Lines</h2>

<p>Shading is coming up in the next section of this course, but having a good understanding of cross contour lines will be helpful. When shading, you can pull your strokes across the form to describe the 3D qualities. This creates a powerful illusion of depth.</p>

<p>Cross contours are essential for creating three-dimensional drawings. They help you construct forms, shade details, and visualize your drawings in 3D. Practice these concepts to improve your drawing skills and make your artwork more dynamic and realistic.</p>
