<p>When I start drawing different characters, I always consider their <strong>body shapes and costumes</strong> first. It's crucial to understand that in the early stages, the <strong>core or center mass</strong> of the character remains the same, and I adjust its size to fit the specific character I'm envisioning. This concept of a <strong>consistent core</strong> in character design is fundamental to creating diverse and unique characters.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Core for Character Diversity</h2>

<p>To achieve character diversity, I make various adjustments to the core's size and proportions. These adjustments can include making the chest <strong>bigger, smaller</strong>, or altering the character's height into different shapes. Initially, I think in terms of a <strong>standard human form</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>For a <strong>shorter, stocky character</strong>, I maintain the same core but reposition the head and focus on the character's volume and the space they occupy.</li>

<li>After establishing the human core, I determine the general areas where limbs and other body parts will be, without focusing on details.</li>

<li>For a <strong>long, skinny character</strong>, I keep the core the same but adjust the pelvic area and limb lengths accordingly.</li>

<li>When drawing <strong>female characters</strong>, I apply the same principles but might emphasize the hips more.</li>

</ul>

<p>It's important to note that the core remains consistent across all characters, regardless of size or position, including characters in lying positions.</p>

<h2>Proportions and Comic Book Characters</h2>

<p>In comic book art, making the character's head slightly smaller than anatomically correct proportions can make them appear more <strong>heroic</strong>. The standard for comic book characters is often to aim for a height of <strong>nine heads tall</strong>, adjusting the head size to achieve a slightly smaller than normal appearance. This approach to character design emphasizes the importance of maintaining a consistent core while allowing for variations to define unique character traits.</p>

<p>The key to drawing different characters lies in the balance between maintaining a <strong>consistent core</strong> and allowing for variations that define unique character traits. By adjusting the core for character diversity and considering specific proportions for comic book characters, artists can create a wide range of characters that are both unique and recognizable.</p>
