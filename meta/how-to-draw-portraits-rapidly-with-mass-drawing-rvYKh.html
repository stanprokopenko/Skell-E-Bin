<p>Hi, I'm Stephen Bauman, and in this video, I'm going to show you a technique called <strong>mass drawing</strong>. It's one of the fastest ways to get a portrait drawing on your paper and recognizable. It's also the newest addition to my block-in course on proko.com. In this demo, I'll work fast and rough, sharing insights and techniques that make mass drawing so effective for portraiture.</p>

<p>Here's the thing about mass drawing: it's incredibly rapid. It's a lot like painting. Think of your pencil as a paintbrush the size of your index finger. </p>

<h2>Initial Steps in Mass Drawing</h2>

<p>I start with a series of <strong>value shapes</strong> that roughly represent the shadow below the nose, the shadow of the eye socket on the left-hand side, and maybe up the edge of the temporal line. Even at this point, we can start taking measurements. For instance, I want to know where the back edge of the cast shadow lines up with the shadow shape in the upper inner corner of the eye socket. I use the edge of my pencil to measure this.</p>

<p>You can choose to do this now or later, but I take my stump and punch up the core shadow a bit. This serves as an <strong>anchor point</strong>. In block-ins and early drawings, you want a <strong>point of truth</strong>. Since we're not working from the outside in, our point of truth happens inside the drawing. I use the eye socket as a point of truth, a unit of measurement.</p>

<h2>Developing the Drawing</h2>

<p>With the eye socket as my point of truth, I measure the length from the top of the brow ridge down to the shadow on the nose. I adjust the distance accordingly. Next, I measure from the cheekbone down to the outside corner of the mouth, and maybe all the way down to the chin. I compare these measurements to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p>I block in all the value that comes after this, using the side of my pencil. <strong>Avoid using lines</strong>; focus on the meetings of values. This might be difficult if you're not used to drawing this way, but in mass drawing, you're dealing with values, not lines.</p>

<h2>Refining the Drawing</h2>

<p>I incorporate a value in the background to give a full view of the light shape of the head. This stage involves a <strong>reasonable expectation of inaccuracy</strong>. I know my block-in isn't perfect and will need changes. Mass drawing relies on a strong sense of <strong>naive recognition</strong>. If your picture resembles your source image a bit, you can make adjustments based on likeness without taking measurements.</p>

<h2>Detailed Measurements and Adjustments</h2>

<p>Now, we need to make a bunch of measurements. I use a harder pencil (an F lead) to triangulate. Every shape exists in reference to a non-objective grid, lining up horizontally and vertically. For example, the apex of the light shape of the cheekbone lines up with something along the contour. I break down and triangulate these distances to make the abstract phase as accurate as possible.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>I mass in the eyes, leaving the eyelid out for now. I push the value out on the left-hand side to eventually make a shape around the ear, anchoring the head in space. Using a saturated stump, I remove light value from darker areas. All triangulation should happen now because we won't want to change things later.</p>

<p>I use a mono zero eraser to carve in where the eyelids will be. For the ear, I measure from the outside corner of the nostril to the high point of the ear, comparing it to the light shape of the forehead. I ensure the ear's value is correct, replacing any erased value.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Mass Drawing</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Good Light and Shadow Dichotomy</strong>: Your source image or model setup should have a strong contrast of shadow and light. This helps divide the image into large flat shapes of dark and light.</li>

<li><strong>Recommended Materials</strong>: Start with a 4B or 6B pencil for strong contrast. These soft grades of graphite are easy to manipulate with a paper stump.</li>

<li><strong>Practice</strong>: The first attempt might not be successful. Aim for at least five or six reps to understand how mass drawing fits into your workflow.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Integration with Other Block-In Techniques</h2>

<p>Mass drawing is one of four block-in styles you'll practice in the block-in course. The other styles are visual, structural, and hybrid. Practice and understand each style separately to integrate them into your drawing process and become a proficient portrait artist.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this lesson. Remember, practice is key to mastering mass drawing. I look forward to seeing you in the block-in course on Proko.</p>
