<h2>The Challenge of Discussing Colors</h2>

<p>Talking about colors can be tricky because there are so many colors we can see and pick with our digital tools. It's impractical, if not impossible, to refer to colors individually. For example, if I show you two shades of red, both are red, but how do we define which is which? The same goes for green. This is the problem with using hue alone to talk about color—it's too limited.</p>

<p>You might think adding saturation and value to the discussion would help, but even then, it can be challenging. We need a new language to identify and talk about subtle differences between colors. This is where <strong>color temperature</strong> comes in.</p>

<p><strong>Color temperature</strong> is a way to talk about a color's relationship to another color rather than the color itself. You're probably familiar with the two main aspects of color temperature: <strong>warm</strong> and <strong>cool</strong>. Warm colors are like fire—reds, oranges, and yellows. Cool colors are like water, ice, and sky—blues, purples, and cyans. These two families sit on opposite sides of the color wheel.</p>

<p>When you shift your hue around the wheel, you are shifting color temperature. This simple method of understanding color is profound because it shifts the conversation from talking about the identity of one color to the relationships of multiple colors as a whole.</p>

<p>In painting, you're never evaluating a color in isolation. You're tracking where it is on its journey from warm to cool or vice versa. Think of warm and cool as two train stops. Most of the time, you're somewhere in transit between the two.</p>

<h2>Practical Exercises with Color Temperature</h2>

<h3>Using Hue to Shift Between Warm and Cool</h3>

<p>Let's create a color chart using hue to shift between warm and cool.</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Pick a warm color</strong>: Start with a saturated orange.</li>

<li><strong>Pick a cool color</strong>: Choose a stereotypically cool color like blue.</li>

<li><strong>Create swatches</strong>: Gradually shift the hue from the warm color to the cool color, painting new swatches as you go.</li>

</ol>

<p>By the time you're in the middle of your chart, you should be halfway between the two colors. This exercise helps you see how colors transition from warm to cool using just hues.</p>

<h3>Using Saturation to Shift Between Warm and Cool</h3>

<p>Now, let's create a color chart using saturation to move from warm to cool.</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Pick a warm color</strong>: Start with a saturated orange.</li>

<li><strong>Pick a cool color</strong>: Choose a blue.</li>

<li><strong>Create a gray in the middle</strong>: Place a perfect gray in the middle of your chart.</li>

<li><strong>Desaturate gradually</strong>: Progress from your warm color to the gray, reducing saturation with each step. Do the same from the cool color to the gray.</li>

</ol>

<p>This chart shows how you can move from warm to cool using grays, which is common in nature.</p>

<h3>Combining Hue and Saturation</h3>

<p>Let's combine both hue and saturation to create a more sophisticated color chart.</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Pick a warm color</strong>: Start with a saturated orange.</li>

<li><strong>Pick a cool color</strong>: Choose a blue.</li>

<li><strong>Create a gray in the middle</strong>: Place a perfect gray in the middle of your chart.</li>

<li><strong>Shift hue and desaturate</strong>: Gradually change the hue and reduce saturation as you move from warm to cool.</li>

</ol>

<p>This combined approach gives you more flexibility and a better understanding of color transitions.</p>

<h2>Application in Real Paintings</h2>

<h3>Analyzing John Singer Sargent's Work</h3>

<p>Let's look at how John Singer Sargent uses color temperature in his paintings. By sampling colors from his work, we can create a color chart that shows the movement from warm to cool.</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Identify warm and cool areas</strong>: Look for areas with reds, yellows, and blues.</li>

<li><strong>Sample colors</strong>: Use a color picker to sample these areas and place them on your chart.</li>

<li><strong>Observe transitions</strong>: Notice how colors transition from warm to cool and how grays play a role in these transitions.</li>

</ol>

<p>Sargent's limited palette of red, yellow, and blue allows him to create a full range of color temperature, moving from warm to cool and back. This movement is crucial for creating expressive paintings.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Understanding and using color temperature is essential for creating nuanced and sophisticated paintings. By practicing these exercises, you can improve your ability to use color effectively. Remember, it's not just about the colors themselves but their relationships and transitions. Keep practicing, and you'll see your paintings come to life with vibrant, expressive colors.</p>
