<p>I'm Slooh, and my art creation process is quite unique. I love to dress up models with <strong>props and awesome lighting</strong> to capture photos that I then use as references for my paintings. I have a strong preference for doing everything in-house, which includes creating props myself, like using gauge wire to make a simple circlet.</p>

<h2>The Creative Process and Preparation</h2>

<h3>Experimenting with Outfits and Props</h3>

<p>For a recent project, I decided on a <strong>Regal elf self-portrait</strong>. This involved experimenting with different outfits and props to see what works best. The creative process is filled with a lot of problem-solving and adapting, such as changing outfits and props to get the desired look. I always focus on what will look best both as a painting and a video, balancing my roles as a YouTuber and a fine artist.</p>

<h3>Importance of Lighting</h3>

<p><strong>Lighting</strong> plays a crucial role in my work. I have a preference for key light and rim light to create separation from the background. This is essential for capturing the right mood and detail in my reference photos.</p>

<h3>Preparing for Painting</h3>

<p>Before I start the actual painting, I like to do a study in my oil painting sketchbook. This allows me to experiment with colors and techniques. Being organized and preparing thoroughly before starting a project is key to my success as a full-time artist.</p>

<h2>The Role of Digital Tools</h2>

<p>I use digital tools like <strong>Playbook</strong> to manage and organize my files and collaborate with others on projects. These tools are indispensable for keeping my work streamlined and efficient.</p>

<h2>Reflections on Success and Artistic Freedom</h2>

<h3>Perspectives on "Making It" as an Artist</h3>

<p>Reflecting on my journey, I've realized that "making it" as an artist has evolved, especially with the rise of social media. My goal has always been to create art that attracts viewership, knowing that financial support would follow. Success for me is not just about making money but also about having the freedom to create what I want and when I want.</p>

<h3>Valuing Freedom and Autonomy</h3>

<p>The freedom and autonomy to pursue my creative interests are more valuable to me than financial gain alone. This project, a self-portrait, required a disciplined approach, focusing on detail and taking my time to ensure quality. I believe one of my weaknesses is working too quickly, especially when mixing paint, which I consciously tried to avoid in this project.</p>

<h2>Engaging with the Audience</h2>

<p>I'm interested in hearing others' thoughts on what it means to "make it" as an artist in today's digital age. I value the feedback and comments from my audience, as it helps me understand their perspectives and improve my work.</p>
