<p>This week, we're kicking off with a straightforward assignment that involves painting a <strong>red rubber ball</strong>. To make things easier, we'll start with a <strong>black and white version</strong> of this object. This task is designed to be simple, allowing you to focus on the basics of digital painting.</p>

<h2>Preparing for the Assignment</h2>

<h3>Setting Up the Digital Workspace</h3>

<p>First, you'll need to open the image file in Photoshop. I've taken several photographs of the ball, but we'll begin with the black and white version. Here's how to get started:</p>

<ul>

<li>Go to <strong>File &gt; Open</strong> and navigate to the folder containing the image file, named <strong>Simple Shapes 03ABW</strong>.</li>

<li>Adjust the window size to make the workspace comfortable for painting.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Selecting the Right Brushes</h3>

<p>For this assignment, you'll need specific brushes depending on the software you're using. Here's a breakdown:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Photoshop</strong>: Download and import the <strong>JV Chalky</strong> brush. This brush offers a nice texture and opacity control, making it ideal for painting.</li>

<li><strong>Krita</strong>: Use the <strong>wet textured soft brush</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Affinity Photo</strong>: Select the <strong>Classic Oil Smooth</strong> brush from the oils category.</li>

<li><strong>Clip Studio Paint</strong>: Choose the <strong>gouache</strong> brush from the thick pastels.</li>

<li><strong>Procreate</strong>: Opt for the <strong>turpentine brush</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>These brushes were chosen for their texture and pressure sensitivity, which are crucial for this painting exercise.</p>

<h2>Painting Instructions</h2>

<h3>Starting the Painting Process</h3>

<p>Begin by opening the black and white image of the sphere. You'll be painting directly on a new layer above this image. Here's the process:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use the <strong>color picker</strong> (Option key on Mac or Alt key on Windows) to select colors directly from the image.</li>

<li>Start by painting the base where the sphere rests, then move on to the sphere itself.</li>

<li>Initially, your painting might not look perfect, but the goal is to improve through practice.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Techniques and Tips</h3>

<p>As you paint, focus on capturing the <strong>shadows and highlights</strong> of the sphere. Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>

<li>Adjust the <strong>brush size</strong> using bracket keys for detailed work and cleanup.</li>

<li>Stay <strong>loose and rough</strong> at first to establish the basic tones and shapes.</li>

<li>Avoid using <strong>multiple layers</strong> or <strong>undo</strong> functions. Treat this exercise as if you're painting on a physical canvas.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Additional Challenges and Expectations</h2>

<p>Once you're comfortable with the black and white version, challenge yourself with the <strong>color version</strong> of the sphere. Aim to complete <strong>three black and white images</strong> for practice. This will prepare you for more complex subjects in future assignments.</p>

<h2>Feedback and Support</h2>

<p>For those enrolled in the mentored portion of this course, please post your completed images to the <strong>Discord channel</strong> for feedback.</p>

<p>This assignment is designed to help you get comfortable with digital painting tools and techniques. A <strong>sped-up video demonstration</strong> is included to show that this task can be accomplished with just one brush. Remember, the key to improvement is practice. Good luck, and I look forward to seeing your work!</p>
