<p>The emergence of powerful AI language models like ChatGPT has sparked both excitement and fear, as they encroach upon intellectual tasks that have long been considered uniquely human. This development challenges our historical conception of the intellect as the defining characteristic separating humans from animals, an idea espoused by thinkers from Aristotle to Chekhov. In a knowledge work economy, where we largely define ourselves by what we know, the prospect of AI replacing human intellect can feel deeply threatening to our sense of self.</p>

<p>However, by understanding what ChatGPT actually does and using it as a lens to examine our own capabilities, we can adapt our self-conception and redefine what makes us uniquely human in the age of AI. Rather than replacing us, ChatGPT can help us appreciate the richness of our intellect in new ways.</p>

<h2>ChatGPT: The Ultimate Summarizer</h2>

<p>At its core, ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful summarizer and transmitter of existing knowledge. As an extension of technologies like writing, the printing press, and the internet, it enhances our ability to efficiently share information and coordinate as a species. ChatGPT excels at reformatting the sum total of human knowledge and bringing it to bear in any given context, acting as an engine for cultural evolution and production.</p>

<h2>Subtracting Summarizing, Highlighting Human Richness</h2>

<p>Once we recognize ChatGPT's primary function as summarizing, we can begin to subtract this skill from our own sense of self. Much of our daily work, from emails to articles to code, involves summarizing information. By allowing ChatGPT to handle this "creative drudgery," we can focus on the many other aspects of our intellect that make us uniquely human, such as our life experiences, emotional capacities, and ability to direct and evaluate the AI's output.</p>

<p>Rather than being replaced by ChatGPT, we can become the managers and editors of its summaries, leveraging its efficiency to be more productive while appreciating the adaptability and flexibility of our own minds. This process of redefinition highlights the richness of human skills that we may have previously overlooked.</p>

<h2>Technology as a Lens on the Intellect</h2>

<p>Just as the drug lithium helped differentiate bipolar disorder from other mental illnesses, acting as a pharmacological dissection tool, ChatGPT can serve as a technological dissection tool for the intellect. By understanding what it can do, we can use it as a lever to clarify and refine our previously fuzzy concept of intellect, adapting our sense of self in the process.</p>

<h2>Culture and Technology Shape Human Identity</h2>

<p>The story of William Buckley, an English convict who survived in the Australian wilderness by being adopted by an Aboriginal tribe, illustrates how dramatically culture and technology shape human abilities and identity. Our brains are wired to learn the skills and knowledge we need to thrive in whatever ecological niche we find ourselves in. </p>

<p>ChatGPT is the latest in a long line of cultural and technological advances that are rewiring us as a species. Rather than fearing this change, we can embrace it as an opportunity to increase the richness and beauty in the world by better understanding and appreciating our uniquely human qualities. Together, we can navigate this new frontier in the evolution of the human intellect.</p>
