<p>Nathan OD asks about the strongest common themes between the current state of AI and web 1.0. This question arises often due to the significant impact of the internet boom, which many still remember. People tend to reason by analogy, comparing the AI boom to the internet boom and starting an AI company to starting an internet company. However, the analogy doesn't fully work. While there are some similarities, the fundamental differences between the internet and AI make the comparison limited.</p>

<h2>Differences Between Internet and AI</h2>

<p>The internet was a <strong>network</strong> that connected many existing computers and facilitated the creation of new ones. The dynamics of the internet industry revolved around building networks or applications that ran on top of networks. This led to phenomena like network effects, where the value of a network increased as more people joined, and competitive dynamics focused on gaining and retaining users.</p>

<p>In contrast, AI is more like a <strong>computer</strong>. Specifically, it's akin to a microprocessor or a new kind of computer. Traditional computers, known as Von Neumann machines, are deterministicâ€”they perform the same task every time and any errors are due to programming mistakes. AI, particularly large language models, are probabilistic computers. They process data in a way that can vary, sometimes even arguing with users or refusing to answer questions. This makes AI fundamentally different from traditional computers, offering new capabilities like understanding language and images.</p>

<h2>Historical Context of the Computer Industry</h2>

<p>The computer industry has evolved significantly over time:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mainframes</strong>: The original computers were large, expensive, and few in number. Thomas Watson Sr., the creator of IBM, famously said he didn't think the world would need more than five computers.</li>

<li><strong>Mini-computers</strong>: These were smaller and less expensive than mainframes but still costly, making them accessible mainly to midsize companies.</li>

<li><strong>PCs and Smartphones</strong>: The advent of personal computers and later smartphones made computing accessible to individuals, with prices dropping to $2,500 for PCs and $500 for smartphones.</li>

<li><strong>Embedded Systems</strong>: Today, computers are ubiquitous, embedded in everything from thermostats to cars, often costing just pennies.</li>

</ul>

<p>This evolution shows a trend towards decreasing costs and increasing accessibility, leading to a massive pyramid of computing devices, from supercomputers to tiny embedded systems.</p>

<h2>Predictions for the Future of AI Models</h2>

<p>If the analogy to the computer industry's evolution holds, we can expect a similar diversity in AI models. There will likely be AI models of every conceivable shape, size, and capability, trained on various data types and operating at different scales. This will create an entire ecosystem of AI models, rather than a few dominant "God models."</p>

<h2>Lock-In and User Adoption in AI</h2>

<p>Historically, a significant source of lock-in for computing systems was their complexity. For example, IBM mainframes were a safe choice because people were trained to use them, and switching systems was difficult. Similarly, Apple's dominance in smartphones is partly due to the high cost and complexity of switching to a different platform.</p>

<p>AI, however, is the easiest computer to use by far. It interacts in natural language, making it more accessible. This raises questions about what will create lock-in for AI. Will users be free to choose the AI model that best fits their needs, or will there be dominant models that users are locked into? This remains an open question, but it highlights the unique nature of AI compared to previous generations of computing technology.</p>
