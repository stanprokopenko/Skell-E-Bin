<h2>One Point Perspective</h2>

<p>One point perspective involves a <strong>single vanishing point</strong>. The <strong>horizon line</strong> is crucial in this type of perspective. Vertical and horizontal lines remain straight, making it simple and effective for many scenarios. You can place the vanishing point anywhere on the horizon line. This method highlights only one vanishing point, making it straightforward to use.</p>

<h2>Two Point Perspective</h2>

<p>Two point perspective uses <strong>two vanishing points</strong>. These vanishing points should be far apart to avoid a warped look. This type of perspective is useful for group shots, vehicles, and establishing shots. It adds depth and dimension to your drawings.</p>

<h2>Three Point Perspective</h2>

<p>Three point perspective involves a <strong>third vanishing point</strong>, often off the page. This creates a dynamic and dramatic effect, making it useful for intense scenes. It is common in manga but less so in American comics. Although challenging, mastering three point perspective can set you apart in the field.</p>

<h2>Fish Eye Perspective</h2>
