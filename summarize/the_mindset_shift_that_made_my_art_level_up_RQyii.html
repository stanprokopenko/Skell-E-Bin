<p>Have you ever felt so frustrated with your art that you questioned if it should even be your career? I've been there, and I still have those days. But everything changed for me with one mindset shift. In this video, I'm drawing a giant fox facing off against a character, which I think is a perfect metaphor for the creative challenges we face as artists. It's like a monumental effort to create something from nothing. If you're interested, you can download the line art of this drawing and ink it yourself.</p>

<h2>The Mindset Shift</h2>

<p>This shift in perspective has made me more productive and, more importantly, more satisfied with my work. Let's dive into the three key aspects that contributed to this change.</p>

<h3>Making Magic</h3>

<p>Creating something from nothing is essentially magic. Whether you're writing, drawing, making music, or any other form of art, you're conjuring up something where there was nothing. The greatest event in history, the creation of the universe from nothing, mirrors what artists do every time they sit down to create. So, don't feel bad if it's hard. It's supposed to be challenging.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Failure</h3>

<p>Failure is an inevitable part of the creative process. It should be seen as a diagnostic tool for growth. Success can often blind us to the role luck played, but failure lays bare all the factors, including our own shortcomings. The key is to learn from these failures and let them inform your next attempt. I used to think I'd reach a point where every project was perfect, but I've realized that you never stop failing; you just fail in different ways. If you're not failing, you're not pushing yourself hard enough. The "rule of thirds" from sports applies here: one-third of the time, you should feel great; one-third, okay; and one-third, like you're failing. This balance indicates you're in the right spot for growth.</p>

<h3>Day Trading Creativity</h3>

<p>The worst thing you can do as an artist is to "day trade" your creativity, obsessing over daily successes or failures. This approach is akin to day trading in the stock market, where focusing on short-term fluctuations leads to missing the bigger picture. Instead, think like long-term investors who make consistent deposits and check on their progress periodically. What matters is showing up every day and making a little progress, not the daily ups and downs. Every so often, assess your trajectory to see if you're growing and improving.</p>

<h2>Motivational Mantra</h2>

<p>To help me focus on the long-term trajectory and not get bogged down by daily fluctuations, I repeat a mantra every morning: "Some days you hunt the raptor, some days the raptor hunts you, but you always dress for the hunt." This reminds me that what's important is showing up and being ready to create, regardless of the day's outcome. Find a mantra that works for you and use it to stay motivated.</p>
