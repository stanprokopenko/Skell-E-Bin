<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>Your task is to dive into the world of materials and lighting in art. This assignment is designed to push you beyond just thinking about the local color of objects. Instead, you'll focus on understanding how different materials respond to light. This is a crucial skill in creating more realistic and dynamic artworks.</p>

<h2>Understanding Materials and Lighting</h2>

<p><strong>Materials and lighting</strong> play a pivotal role in art, affecting how objects appear in different environments. It's essential to move past considering only the local color of an object. You need to think about:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>The essence of the material</strong>: What makes it unique? How does it feel, and how does it react under various lighting conditions?</li>

<li><strong>Lighting conditions</strong>: How does light interact with the material? Observe the changes in appearance under different lighting scenarios.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding these aspects will significantly enhance your ability to depict materials realistically in your artwork.</p>

<h2>Practical Application</h2>

<p>To put this into practice, you're encouraged to:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Use provided sketches</strong>: Start with the simple, somewhat cartoony characters I've provided. These sketches serve as a base for you to apply your understanding of materials and lighting.</li>

<li><strong>Observe real-world objects or photography</strong>: Look at objects around you or in photographs. Pay close attention to the material's essence and how it responds to light. Try to replicate this in your artwork.</li>

</ol>

<p>This hands-on approach will help you grasp the nuances of different materials and how they interact with light.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The ultimate goal of this assignment is to replicate the essence of materials under various lighting conditions. By focusing on the material's response to light rather than just its color, you'll be able to create more lifelike and compelling artworks. This skill is invaluable in elevating your art to the next level, making your creations stand out with a sense of realism and depth.</p>
