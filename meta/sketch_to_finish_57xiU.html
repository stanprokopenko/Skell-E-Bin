<h2>Sketching the Character</h2>

<p>I start the character creation process by sketching with <strong>basic shapes</strong> like circles, cylinders, and squares to give form to the character. I refine this initial sketch using a <strong>lightbox</strong>, which helps me transfer the rough details onto a new page for a clearer layout and further development. I keep the sketch rough on the lightbox, ensuring all essential information is accurately transferred. This stage is crucial for resolving most of the character's details to avoid problem-solving during the final drawing phase. In the sketch, I keep facial details minimal, planning to adjust elements like the eyes and jawline during the lightboxing process. I then transition from analog to digital by printing out a digital version of the sketch to refine further, allowing for adjustments before inking.</p>

<h2>Understanding Anatomy and Light</h2>

<p>During the penciling stage, my focus is on <strong>anatomy, light, and shadow</strong>. I use a red pencil to map out shading and make dynamic adjustments to the character's pose. It's important to emphasize the understanding of form and light to make informed adjustments and avoid committing too early to a specific drawing. I use both graphite and colored pencils for underdrawing, with the colored pencil indicating where to apply shadows during inking.</p>

<h2>Preparing for Inking</h2>

<p>The standard size for my work is between <strong>11x17 and 12x18 inches</strong>, which I find most comfortable for detailed illustration. Occasionally, I need to reference the character's design details, such as the number and placement of accessories like nunchucks. Adjustments to the character's pose and proportions are made based on a more fleshed-out understanding of the character and the illustration's needs. My education at Benedict College under Professor Tyrone Jeter introduced me to fundamental drawing techniques and influential painters.</p>

<h2>Inking Techniques</h2>

<p>I prefer to ink the face last, ensuring I'm comfortable with the brush and the character's overall form before adding final details. I use a combination of <strong>traditional brush and Pentel brush pen</strong> for inking, starting with contour lines and employing a feathering technique for shadows. The rough paper texture aids in achieving a dry brush effect for shadows, enhancing the illustration's depth and realism. I rotate the page to get the best angle for smooth brush strokes, moving the brush away from my body for smoother lines. My inking process is non-linear, moving across different parts of the illustration to maintain consistency and balance in the ink application. I find synthetic hair brushes effective for fine, feathering type lines, similar to traditional brushes. For dead line weight, microns work well, but for smaller areas, turning the brush can achieve a dry brush feel. Sometimes my contour lines are thicker than intended, but it's okay because I plan to add heavy blacks and shadows. Flipping the page helps me get a controlled line, especially for curves. Stopping and continuing without showing a break in the line is crucial. Brushes offer better control over lines compared to pens, which show where the line starts and stops. Using a non-traditional brush requires more mindfulness in laying down lines to avoid them being too thick or the ink drying unevenly. My goal in inking is not to create perfectly smooth lines but effective ones that serve the drawing.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Reflections</h2>

<p>Filling in larger black areas can be nerve-wracking as it might not look as good as in the pencil stage, but it's part of the learning process. Making mistakes is essential for growth; fearing imperfection hinders development. Sometimes, when in doubt, I black out areas to solve problems or add texture. Inking requires improvisation and adaptation, especially when dealing with ink drying times. The evolution of comic art has shown the importance of being a total package as an artist, capable of both drawing and writing. Spinning the page helps avoid smudging wet ink and is necessary for working with different paper types and ink drying times. I prefer toothy paper like Strathmore vellum for its grip and how it interacts with ink. For precise details, I sometimes use a technical pen, especially for hard edges or firm lines. Inking involves navigating the artwork with various tools, from brushes to pens, to achieve the desired effect. My basic approach to inking involves outlining, adding shadows, and then riffing with lines to add detail and texture. The final stages of inking involve careful decision-making about shadow placement and cleaning up excess graphite. Adding ink splatters and other effects can add dimension and interest to the artwork. Problem-solving and adapting techniques are crucial, especially when working on assignments with time constraints. Signing the artwork is a final touch that I sometimes forget but is an important part of finishing a piece. Continuously playing with the artwork, even after the main inking is done, helps balance and refine the piece.</p>
