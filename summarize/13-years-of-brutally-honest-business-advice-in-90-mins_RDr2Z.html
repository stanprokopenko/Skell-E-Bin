<p>I've been in business for 13 years and sold nine companies. My last company sold for $46.2 million. I own acquisition.com, which currently does about $17 million a month across our portfolio. I'm compressing 13 years of brutal business truths and lessons into this one video.</p>

<h2>Selling Strategies</h2>

<h3>Sell to Rich People First</h3>

<p><strong>Sell to rich people until you have the money to sell to poor people.</strong> The middle market is where you get killed. Elon Musk said you can either do a lot of good for a small number of people or a little good for a large number of people. It's harder to do a little good for a lot of people than a lot of good for a small number of people.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong>

- <strong>Tesla</strong> started by selling to rich people with the Roadster at $250,000. They then moved down-market to sell $100,000 cars, then the Model X, and finally the Model 3.

- <strong>Amazon</strong> aimed for the best selection and lowest prices.

- <strong>Walmart</strong> focused on everyday low prices.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of selling to rich people:</strong>

- <strong>Higher margins:</strong> Rich people are willing to pay more in absolute terms for lower relative value.

- <strong>Ability to over-deliver:</strong> With extra profit or gross margin, you can over-deliver and still make money.

- <strong>Solve rich people's problems:</strong> They pay better and are willing to pay for time above all else.

- <strong>Premium pricing:</strong> Selling premium to wealthy people allows for inefficiencies and still making money.</p>

<h3>Moving Down-Market</h3>

<p><strong>Transitioning to serve the masses</strong> requires significant infrastructure and efficiency. Selling based on low cost requires infrastructure for huge demand. Efficiency is crucial when selling to poor people.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong>

- <strong>Netflix</strong> provides immense value for a low cost.

- <strong>Amazon Prime</strong> competes with services like Netflix, requiring significant upfront investment and infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>

- <strong>Infrastructure for handling massive volumes:</strong> Starting a bank, for example, requires $25 to $100 million and infrastructure for handling massive volumes.

- <strong>Long-term investment:</strong> Selling to the masses requires a long-term investment and infrastructure to handle volume.

- <strong>Efficiency and volume:</strong> Walmart and Amazon win on efficiency and volume.</p>

<p><strong>Be clear about who you serve</strong> and only go down-market if you have the infrastructure. Build for volume and efficiency like Amazon or Walmart, or build for a premium niche.</p>

<h2>Prioritization</h2>

<h3>Lack of Priorities, Not Information</h3>

<p><strong>You lack priorities, not information.</strong> Problems are easy to solve if you know what you're after. An entrepreneur with 56 companies making $10 million a year could easily 5x his main business by focusing on it. Prioritizing the main business can lead to significant growth. </p>

<p>I talked to him, and he hadn't slept for three days after our conversation because he was so focused on the strategy. <strong>Strategy is about prioritizing resources</strong> like time, money, and people against unlimited options. Having a clear goal for a company and customer makes prioritization easier. Many people lack a clear goal and don't define the problem they're trying to solve.</p>

<p>When people are stuck in their business, I ask them about their goal and the problem they're solving. If you can't clearly state the current state, desired state, and obstacle, you're not going to solve anything.</p>

<h3>Solving the Right Problems</h3>

<p><strong>Identifying and addressing core business issues</strong> is crucial. A media company with 40 million subscribers approached me, wanting to optimize their SOPs for monetization. They had no product to sell, which was a major issue for monetization. If they had a product, they could make more money than just improving their media quality. They were solving the wrong problem by focusing on media instead of monetization.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs often solve problems they are comfortable with, not necessarily the ones that need solving. A guy at a workshop asked about the closer framework, but his business's problem wasn't sales. He was a sales guy and wanted to hear about sales, but his business had other issues.</p>

<p><strong>Balancing strengths and business needs</strong> is essential. Entrepreneurs should double down on their strengths but ensure the business as a whole is balanced. A business is like a body; it needs balanced development in all areas. The business will be constrained by its weakest link. Marketing entrepreneurs often don't have marketing problems; product entrepreneurs often don't have product problems. Entrepreneurs need to learn or recruit skills they lack.</p>

<h2>Hiring and Talent Management</h2>

<h3>Importance of Top Talent</h3>

<p><strong>High standards and continuous improvement</strong> are essential for business growth. Successful entrepreneurs emphasize the importance of talent. The right hire can significantly impact business growth. </p>

<p><strong>Example: Amazon's hiring rule</strong> - Every new hire should raise the average bar of the team. Companies tend to dilute talent unless controlled for. Hiring smarter people continuously improves the team and the company. </p>

<p><strong>Impact of experienced hires on business growth</strong> - Business growth is like a Christmas tree, dependent on the number and intelligence of brains. Early hires often lack experience, limiting business growth. Prefer hiring experienced individuals to avoid learning from scratch. Early companies often have inexperienced people in leadership roles.</p>

<h3>Addressing Performance Issues</h3>

<p><strong>Hard conversations and performance management</strong> are necessary to address performance issues. Mediocrity often persists due to avoidance of difficult discussions. Reframe performance issues as opportunities for growth and investment. Bringing in experienced individuals can be a significant investment in current employees. Communication issues can lead to misunderstandings about performance.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding mediocrity and promoting based on readiness</strong> - Promotions should be based on readiness, not tenure or personal relationships. The Peter Principle: people get promoted to their level of incompetence. Poorly equipped employees can lead to inefficiency and stagnation. Business challenges often stem from emotional difficulty, not complexity. Firing is easier when there is clear misconduct. Difficult conversations are harder with well-meaning but underperforming employees. Investing in experienced talent can be more efficient than training from scratch. Compensation should reflect the value and experience of the talent.</p>

<h2>Branding and Customer Experience</h2>

<h3>Building a Strong Brand</h3>

<p><strong>Building a brand takes a long time but is extremely valuable.</strong> A strong brand allows for higher returns on advertising and customer loyalty. Branding involves creating positive associations between something familiar and the business.</p>

<p><strong>Methods to build a brand:</strong>

- <strong>What you say/show</strong>

- <strong>What others say</strong>

- <strong>Customer experiences</strong></p>

<p>Customer experiences are the strongest factor in shaping brand perception. Exceptional customer experiences lead to positive word-of-mouth and brand loyalty. Referrals involve relational capital, and poor experiences can damage the referrer's credibility. Consistently delivering on promises strengthens the brand.</p>

<p><strong>Example: Apple</strong> - The strength of a brand can be measured by how much above the market price it can charge. Apple retains its customers through strong branding, allowing for premium pricing.</p>

<h3>Branding vs. Direct Response Advertising</h3>

<p><strong>Branding provides better long-term returns on advertising</strong> compared to direct response advertising. Direct response advertising is like a paycheck, providing immediate returns. Branding is like a long-term investment, compounding over time to create significant returns.</p>

<p><strong>Creating positive associations and fulfilling promises</strong> is crucial. Control branding by ensuring your statements about yourself align with positive associations of your target audience. This control extends to content and public associations. Delivering on promises is crucial as experiences weigh heavily on customer perception.</p>

<p><strong>Reviews approximate experiences</strong> and help potential customers gauge the truthfulness of your claims. Customers assess reviews to determine risk before making a purchase. Branding creates a loop that influences purchasing decisions. Fulfilling promises reduces the risk for customers, encouraging repeat purchases.</p>

<h2>Quality and Growth</h2>

<h3>Focus on Quality</h3>

<p><strong>Incremental improvements and high standards</strong> are key to sustainable growth. Growth can be driven by focusing on improving quality rather than just trying to expand. Tactically, this involves improving specific functions of the business incrementally and consistently. Create checklists for each function to ensure continuous improvement and maintain high standards. Accumulating many small improvements (golden BBs) leads to significant overall growth.</p>

<p><strong>Example: Chick-fil-A vs. Boston Market</strong> - Chick-fil-A's focus on quality and responsible growth outlasted Boston Market's rapid expansion. Mission-driven businesses tend to succeed in the long term over mercenary-driven ones. Quality and mission alignment are crucial for long-term success.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainable growth through quality</strong> - Growth should not be pursued for its own sake; it should be a result of getting better at the core business. Businesses that focus solely on making money can become distracted and spread too thin. Prioritize core promises to customers over diversifying into unrelated areas. Allowing too many distractions can prevent meaningful progress.</p>

<h3>High-Leverage Tasks</h3>

<p><strong>Prioritizing impactful work</strong> is essential for business success. Block time for important work that moves the business forward. Most issues are not existential crises and can wait. Prioritize tasks that have the highest leverage and impact on the business. Work uninterrupted on high-leverage tasks for the first four to six hours of the day. Protect this time by scheduling meetings and other activities in the afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>Scheduling and time management strategies</strong> - As the business grows, delegate more tasks to reduce the number of meetings. Be selective about meetings and connections, focusing on those that align with core priorities. Understand that not every connection or opportunity is essential to pursue. If I know my business strategy and execution, anything outside of that loses me money. It's important to be okay with saying no to meetings that don't align with my priorities.</p>

<p>I use a tactic in social settings to defer meetings by citing a significant future event, like a book launch or company sale. This approach provides a socially acceptable reason for declining meetings. I explained to my executive assistants that scheduling meetings in the morning disrupts my deep work. Meetings should be scheduled at the end of the day, starting from the last hour backward. This scheduling method allows me to have uninterrupted time for important tasks. The more my calendar is cleared, the more effective I am, leading to increased revenue.</p>

<h2>Scaling and Execution</h2>

<h3>Understanding Constraints</h3>

<p><strong>Identifying and addressing business constraints</strong> is crucial for scaling. In investment diligence, questioning why spending can't be increased reveals constraints. These constraints could be poor ads, inability to handle call volume, or delivery issues. Skilled individuals can handle vague directions, making smart hires efficient. Understanding the details of processes helps evaluate employee performance.</p>

<p><strong>Example: Investment diligence and scaling ads</strong> - Scaling ads involves pre-work, reviewing top ads, and creating new content. Scaling sales teams requires systematic outreach and handling turnover. Employee turnover should be managed similarly to customer churn.</p>

<h3>Breaking Self-Imposed Limits</h3>

<p><strong>Pushing beyond comfort zones</strong> is necessary for growth. Many entrepreneurs get stuck at a certain level of success because they are comfortable and don't push beyond their limits. To grow, one must break through self-imposed limitations and think bigger, such as spending more on advertising or hiring more staff.</p>

<p><strong>Example: Entrepreneur conducting 200 interviews</strong> - A successful entrepreneur conducted 200 interviews in seven days to build a team quickly, demonstrating high-level execution. Junior entrepreneurs often take longer to achieve similar results due to self-imposed constraints. It's crucial to identify the fundamental actions (inputs) that drive business success and focus on those.</p>

<h2>Content Creation</h2>

<h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>

<p><strong>Importance of high-value content</strong> - It's better to spend significant time creating one exceptional piece of content than producing many mediocre ones. Quality content has outsized returns; a slightly better video can get exponentially more views. People seek high value per second of content, not just more content.</p>

<p><strong>Learning from initial quantity to achieve quality</strong> - Quantity is important initially to learn the effort required for quality, but over time, focus should shift to creating higher quality content. Quality is achieved through repeated refinement, similar to applying multiple coats of paint or sanding down rough edges. The real value is created in the editing and refining process, not just the initial creation.</p>

<p><strong>Example: Refining content for better returns</strong> - Entrepreneurs should distill their knowledge and provide high-value, concise content rather than overwhelming amounts of information. Documenting processes helps maintain quality and makes it easier to train new team members. The best talent costs more but provides significantly higher returns, a concept often missed by small business owners. Big businesses compete for top talent because they understand its value. Small businesses must align their mission with what high-level talent finds meaningful to attract them.</p>

<h2>Mission-Driven Business</h2>

<h3>Attracting High-Level Talent</h3>

<p><strong>Aligning mission with talent values</strong> is crucial for attracting high-level talent. Small businesses must align their mission with what high-level talent finds meaningful. For example, a business in the porn industry struggled to attract high-level talent due to the nature of the work. The level of talent you can attract depends on the perceived value and mission of your business.</p>

<p><strong>Example: Elon Musk's companies</strong> - Musk's businesses are mission-driven, aiming to save the world. 

- <strong>Twitter</strong> is now positioned as a bastion of free speech under Musk.

- <strong>SpaceX</strong> aims to make humanity an interplanetary species to ensure survival.

- <strong>Tesla</strong> focuses on environmentally friendly electronic cars.</p>

<p>Musk's companies attract people who are passionate about saving the world.</p>

<h3>Investing in Talent</h3>

<p><strong>Examples of high returns from top talent</strong> - Investing in high-level talent can lead to significant returns. For instance:

- A $50,000/year employee allowed opening a second location, resulting in $250,000/year profit.

- A $300,000/year salesperson brought in $5 million in sales.

- A $1 million/year executive saved $3 million annually and facilitated company sales.</p>

<p><strong>Importance of addressing core business problems</strong> - Higher investment in talent led to greater returns. Talent is the most underrated money-making opportunity. Business owners often avoid addressing the main problem. Chris Williamson's quote: "The magic you're looking for is the work in the work you're avoiding." Business success often requires confronting uncomfortable truths.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Confronting uncomfortable truths</strong> is essential for business success. Many business owners avoid addressing the main problem, but facing these issues head-on can lead to significant growth.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on product quality and organic growth</strong> before extensive marketing. Mediocre products hinder long-term growth. Successful businesses grow organically before adding marketing efforts. For example, School.com grew through word-of-mouth before significant marketing investment.</p>

<p><strong>Wealth creation</strong> often occurs through valuable opportunities and word-of-mouth. High margins and low acquisition costs lead to significant returns. Sharing valuable content helps creators understand audience needs and drives word-of-mouth in niche markets.</p>
