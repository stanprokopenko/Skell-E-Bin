<p>I've been using my current daily carry sketchbook to draw things either from observation or imagination, based on what I've seen before. While I often play with various subject matters, I've been feeling a need to push the posing more, to capture motion, movement, energy, and action. This goes beyond the technical aspects of drawing; it's about capturing a feeling or an idea that I can almost picture but haven't fully realized on the page.</p>

<h2>Technical Drawing and Its Limitations</h2>

<p>Drawing from memory and observation, like the example of someone throwing a baseball, helps me understand the physical motion and context of the pose. This process involves establishing a framework on the page to avoid running out of space and distorting proportions. However, I've realized that sticking strictly to technical aspects can be limiting. It's important to understand anatomy, perspective, and composition, but there's a point where technical training can hold back the expression and energy I want to capture in my art.</p>

<h2>Exploring Motion and Expression Through Sketching</h2>

<p>To explore different poses and movements, I create multiple sketches, experimenting with various positions and angles. This process is not about creating perfect drawings but about understanding the form and pushing the boundaries of motion and expression. I've learned from conversations with other artists, like Kim Jung Gi, that even those who can draw directly and confidently still engage in this exploratory process. It's a crucial part of capturing dynamic poses and conveying energy through line work, camera angles, and even abstraction.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Fear and Embracing Creativity</h2>

<p>One of the biggest challenges in this journey is overcoming the fear of stepping beyond technical drawing into more expressive art. This fear is partly due to the worry that the results might not meet my own standards or the expectations of others. However, I've found that embracing this fear and allowing myself to create without constraints or preconceived technical constructs can lead to more expressive and energetic drawings. This process involves letting go of logical thinking and allowing my hand to move freely, capturing the essence of motion and expression.</p>

<h2>Reflections on Artistic Growth and Future Directions</h2>

<p>As I continue to explore and experiment, I recognize the importance of balancing technical skill with expressive creativity. This journey is about finding my own style and voice in art, which requires continuous learning and pushing beyond comfort zones. It's a lifelong process that involves not only mastering the fundamentals but also embracing the unknown and the abstract aspects of creativity.</p>

<h2>Practical Advice for Artists</h2>

<p>For those starting their journey in art, I recommend focusing on the fundamentals of drawing, perspective, and anatomy. Setting clear intentions and goals for your art projects can help guide your exploration and growth. Additionally, using tools and resources, like the Proko timer tool, can provide structured practice opportunities to improve your skills. Remember, the journey of artistic growth is about exploration, experimentation, and finding the balance between technical mastery and expressive freedom.</p>
