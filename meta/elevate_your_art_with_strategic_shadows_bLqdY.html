<h2>Initial Composition and Setup</h2>

<p>I started with a <strong>very simple design pattern</strong> for the panel, positioning figures together in a compositional shape. I then outlined them with a <strong>dark lighting pattern</strong> to draw the viewer's eye into the middle, using elements in the foreground to frame the panel. This setup established all elements without shadow, line weights, or rendering.</p>

<h2>Starting with Shadows and Line Weights</h2>

<p>Knowing the lighting was coming from above, I began by shadowing underneath objects and adding line weights. This approach allowed me to <strong>add depth</strong> without making complex compositional decisions about lighting. I focused on making areas under objects darker, gradually establishing line weights to enhance the sense of depth. For figures, areas like under a leg were darkened, and I pressed hard to emphasize these shadows, though I noted this might not be advisable for everyone.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Foreground and Background</h2>

<p>I moved on to the foreground, making lines thicker for closer objects to emphasize their proximity. This technique helps to <strong>create a sense of depth</strong>, with thicker lines for closer objects and thinner lines for those in the background, preventing the image from flattening. I carefully outlined the foreground to make it stand out, using shadows to add dimension to elements like debris by drawing shadows rather than the objects themselves.</p>

<h2>Compositional Lighting and Detailing</h2>

<p>I then focused on <strong>compositional lighting</strong>, aiming to highlight the main figures and elements. I avoided using X's for dark areas, preferring to draw shadows directly to maintain control over how they interact. I detailed the main figures lightly to avoid overcomplication, considering the small working size. Adding shadows behind characters helped to push them forward compositionally, ensuring they remained the focal point.</p>

<h2>Refining Shadows and Adding Final Touches</h2>

<p>As I refined the shadows, making them crisper and adding detail through shadowing, I paid attention to separating elements clearly. I used a piece of paper under my hand to prevent smudging, especially as I worked with a very hard lead. I aimed to delineate shapes clearly before shadowing inside them, though I acknowledged that sometimes the overall shape emerges more organically. I added character to elements like pipes through line weight and shadow, ensuring they contributed to guiding the viewer's eye into the image.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the panel's design was effective in drawing attention through a <strong>simple yet strategic use of dark and light patterns</strong>. I emphasized the importance of layering darks and lights to add depth and dimension, maintaining a basic compositional framework throughout the process. This approach allowed for a gradual build-up of complexity, ensuring the viewer's eye is drawn to the intended focal points while keeping the overall composition cohesive and engaging.</p>
