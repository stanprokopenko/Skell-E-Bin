<p>In this video, we'll be discussing the top 5 drawing mistakes that artists commonly make and how to fix them. This is a follow-up to the previous video on the top 5 shading mistakes, but we'll be excluding shading mistakes as they were already covered. Remember, learning from your mistakes is what makes you a better artist.</p>

<p>Before we dive in, I want to mention that I'm working on a drawing basics course, which is meant to be a new artist's first course. If you don't want to miss it when it comes out, make sure to subscribe to the newsletter at proko.com/subscribe.</p>

<h2>Mistake #5: No Continuity</h2>

<p><strong>Lack of continuity</strong> in drawings is when elements like the edge of a table change levels every time it disappears behind an object, limbs don't line up, or the hilt of a sword changes angles or thickness as it comes out of a hand.</p>

<p>To fix this mistake, use your artistic superpower: <strong>X-ray vision</strong>. Draw through your forms using light lines to make sure everything is the right size and in the right place. As the creator of this world, you need to understand more than you show.</p>

<h2>Mistake #4: Avoiding Weaknesses</h2>

<p>The next mistake is <strong>avoiding drawing things just because you don't know how to draw them</strong>. Everyone's done this at least once, like putting hands in pockets or cropping them out if you can't draw them well.</p>

<p>Avoiding your weaknesses becomes a habit and limits your growth as an artist. Instead, face them head-on and be determined to turn your weaknesses into strengths. Remember, you're not defined by your problems, but by your response to them.</p>

<h2>Mistake #3: Messy Lines</h2>

<p>There's a difference between <strong>intentional messiness and lack of skill</strong>. Messy lines can be fun and free you up from the fear of making lines at all, but don't call it mastery or your style.</p>

<p>Too many lines make a drawing unclear, and unclear drawing is just muttering. Ask yourself if you're using multiple lines because you love that look or because you don't know which line is right.</p>

<p>To fix this, slow down and think about your lines. Train yourself to draw long fluid strokes from your shoulder and short detailed strokes with your wrist. Replace your sloppy habit with deliberate, masterful dexterity.</p>

<h2>Mistake #2: Incorrect Proportions</h2>

<p>Make sure you have enough room on the page for the whole thing you want to draw and get your scale right. Avoid tunnel vision by skipping around from place to place or starting with a large envelope around the whole thing and then breaking it down into smaller pieces.</p>

<p>To control your proportions, you need to <strong>train your eye to see accurately</strong> by checking and double-checking your work. Use measuring techniques with a tool like your pencil to check and correct your proportions. With practice, this process will become subconscious and take no time at all.</p>

<p>If you need a refresher on human proportions or measuring correctly, check out the lessons in the figure fundamentals course.</p>

<h2>Mistake #1: Relying on Symbols</h2>

<p>We all start drawing by using <strong>symbols</strong>, like an emoji for a face or a simplified shape for an eye. However, when we want to draw something that looks like the real thing, we need more than symbols.</p>

<p>The beginner solution is to <strong>learn how to see like an artist</strong> and observe the true shapes as they appear from a specific perspective. Some artists get past symbols by drawing with their eyes squinted or drawing the reference upside down to see it fresh.</p>

<p>The advanced solution is to <strong>learn the anatomy and forms of the things you draw</strong>. Understand the anatomy and three-dimensional forms of your subject to see more than what meets the eye.</p>

<p>If you're going for realism, avoid symbols. But if you're drawing cartoons, simplified animated symbols are acceptable.</p>

<p>Those are the top 5 drawing mistakes you're probably making and how to fix them. Let me know in the comments which of these mistakes you make, and if you have any friends or classmates that make these mistakes, share this video with them to help them out.</p>
